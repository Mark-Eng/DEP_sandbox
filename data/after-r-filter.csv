In response to Typhoon Haiyan , Save the Children Philippines is one of around 45 agencies that chose to implement CTP to meet the various needs of the affected population. Through cash-based assistance, the programme aimed to restore and diversify the livelihoods of the most vulnerable/landless households in targeted rice and corn farming communities severely affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Leyte Province of Region VIII. Market support interventions were implemented for 12 months from January to December 2014 as part of an integrated programme approach and included support to 500 small-scale grocery stores (sari-sari stores). Market support activities included conditional cash grants, working capital and skills development. The cash grants were given in two instalments and varied in value20 between the two locations in which the interventions were implemented. The training was mandatory and conducted before the first cash grant instalment was disbursed. One of the main objectives of the market support activity was to improve market recovery and subsequently the affected populations’ access to food and non-food products. Save the Children Philippines and Save the Children UK’s Humanitarian Technical Unit commissioned this study to review the agency’s use of CTP and market-based responses in the Haiyan response. The study’s objectives are to contribute to Save the Children UK’s global agenda on the inclusion of market analysis in response analysis and project implementation, and the need for evidence on the role of market-based programming in supporting market recovery. The study is also intended to contribute to learning on the design, implementation and monitoring of multi-sector CTP, integrated programming and the potential value for money of these approaches. (p.20); Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets (Celebic, 2014) This document presents the evaluation of the relief-to-development programme ‘Revitalizing Agricultural/Pastoral Incomes and New Markets’ (initially known as RAIN and then RAIN+ with additional funding) implemented in Ethiopia by Mercy Corps that was extended from three years to five years (from 2008–2013). Humanitarian financing was used as a bridge for relief-to-development activities in the Somali and Oromia regions of Ethiopia. Programme activities addressed the immediate needs of drought-affected populations during the food price crisis in an area prone to recurrent humanitarian emergencies, often triggered by climatic events (droughts, ill-timed rains resulting with floods) and further complicated by conflict, insecurity and inadequate governance. The project aimed to: prevent food insecurity and livelihoods collapse via improved preparedness; protect the existing productive asset base to strengthen and diversify livelihoods; and promote market-based business models, local economic development, and economic integration and trade with neighbours. The animal health services and economic recovery, and to a much lesser extent the market system programme components of the wider RAIN programme, are of relevance to this research. The animal health services intervention included providing various forms of support (information sharing and networking, business grants, subsidies, capacity building and skills development) to key actors along the animal healthcare supply chain that provided animal healthcare services in defined localities in the Somali and Oromia regions. Key actors included wholesalers (based in Addis Ababa) that provided certified veterinary medicines, private veterinary pharmacies (PVPs) and community animal healthcare workers (CAHW) or ‘para-vets’ based rurally. Due to a drought that occurred during the programme implementation period, a destocking activity was undertaken within the market system programme component. 17 livestock traders were identified, provided with loans and connected with communities in need of commercial destocking. Over 8,000 small ruminants and 478 cattle were destocked. (p.21); Economic and market resilience before and after shocks (Carter, 2016) This publication provides a rapid overview of the state of evidence on humanitarian and disaster risk reduction interventions that aim to ‘reinforce economic resilience in view of anticipated shocks and support economic recovery after a shock, both in situations of natural disasters and conflict’ (Carter, 2016). Particular attention is paid in the overview to interventions supporting markets critical to affected populations in crises (e.g. markets for basic needs and services, labour markets) as opposed to markets with development opportunities. (p.21-22); Markets in crisis: the 2010 floods in Sindh, Pakistan (Zyck et al., 2015) As part of a series of Overseas Development Initiative (ODI) publications related to markets in crisis, this study looks at how markets and businesses in Sindh province were affected by the 2010 floods. The research reflects on what determined business survival, the extent that people derived resilience as a result of market activity and whether aid efforts supported market resilience and recovery. The document provides general information on the types of market-based activities implemented and insights into programme decisions, and their impact on the business sector. Five market-based interventions following the 2010 floods are cited in this report, of which only one intervention (by Oxfam and Save the Children) can be included in this evidence synthesis due to its outcome resulting in the restoration and maintenance of food markets. No information is provided on the market support activities undertaken by these agencies. (p.22); The Haiti Earthquake: An Urban Solution (Young and Henderson, 2010) In response to growing interest in urban humanitarian programming in the humanitarian sector, this short and concise paper was written to share Oxfam’s urban programme approaches in Haiti in response to the devastating earthquake of 2010. The paper was crafted within a short time-frame following the earthquake and the onset of the market support interventions. Although brief in detail, the paper outlines the different types of assessments undertaken before designing the longer-term food security and livelihood response analysis to inform decision making. The inclusion of market analysis was seen as pivotal to taking a more market-orientated approach to the emergency and early recovery programmes. The paper outlines the various programme responses that Oxfam developed, the targeting methodologies, the activities and impact.

Humanitarian emergencies can impact the mental health and psychosocial well-being of local populations. MHPSS programmes are one way of seeking to reduce negative impacts and provide assistance to affected populations. MHPSS interventions may vary regarding the extent to which they develop contextually unique programmes. We broadly define MHPSS in this review as interventions ""to protect or promote psychosocial wellbeing and/or prevent or treat mental disorder' -- Of the 45 programmes evaluated in the 40 included trials,78–117 over half (n=24) took advantage of whole-school or classroom-based settings to deliver Mental health and psychosocial support programme (MHPSS) programmes to children and young people (CYP). A further 15 studies delivered programmes in community settings generally (n=4) or in refugee camps (n=5), family homes (n=3), outdoor areas for story-telling and drawing, at football games or in church. A total of seven studies did not specify where the programmes were delivered.The majority were group-based, with only eight programmes delivering all or some of their intervention components individually to participants. The MHPSS programmes identified in this review were designed to treat children and provide support and skills for them and their care-givers by using one or more different strategy or technique, including sessions to provide psycho-education and advice. Activities focused on opportunities to share experiences and/or to debate ideas between group members, gain life skills education and/or engage with teachers, schools, parents and the wider community. Social activities focused on child-centred activities such as games, drama, drawing, film, role-play and obtaining access to the Internet. Individual skills also focused on relaxation, breathing techniques and narrative writing exercises. Programme delivery and implementation varied in terms of intensity and duration. Brief programme approaches were characterized by those delivered in single or double sessions,93, 100 while a further two short MHPSS programmes were completed within one week. However, on average, MHPSS programmes were delivered in between four and 15 sessions (n=28), each lasting approximately 60–120 minutes (n=24) and delivered over a period of five to 12 weeks (n=20), with only three delivered in multiple sessions for approximately one school year or for more than one year. Need assessment exercises and previous work experience in the field of study by authors and programme staff informed the adaptation and development of a) intervention strategies in nine programmes; b) intervention content of five programmes; and c) the development and selection of relevant outcome measures in two studies. Moreover, when reported, eight MHPSS programmes were piloted to assess their applicability and acceptability for local contexts and cultures. For example, a schoolbased ERASE-Stress programme for children affected by the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka adapted an Israeli version to the local context by piloting it with small groups of Sri Lankan children and professionals. In another study, during the piloting phase the wording and vocabulary of a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme for children in Thailand affected by the 2004 tsunami were adapted to a local southern dialect.

However, there is limited evidence on the impact of integrating health services with ANC to guide policy. This review assesses the impact of integration of postnatal and other health services with ANC on health services uptake and utilisation, health outcomes and user experience of care in LMICs. Methods Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, POPLINE and Global Health were searched for studies that compared integrated models for delivery of postnatal and other health services with ANC to non–integrated models. Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, depending on the study design. Due to high heterogeneity no meta–analysis could be conducted. Results are presented narratively. Findings 12 studies were included in the review. Limited evidence, with moderate– to high–risk of bias, suggests that integrated service delivery results in improved uptake of essential health services for women, earlier initiation of treatment, and better health outcomes. Women also reported improved satisfaction with integrated services. Conclusions The reported evidence is largely based on non–randomised studies with poor generalizability, and therefore offers very limited policy guidance. More rigorously conducted and geographically diverse studies are needed to better ascertain and quantify the health and economic benefits of integrating health services with ANC.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Human development and gender,HIV/AIDS control,Population policies/programmes and reproductive health,Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,Reproductive health care,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population,Sex,"We included studies focusing on pregnant women of all

Nine of the 12 included studies focused on integration of HIV–related services with antenatal care (ANC). Of these, four studies focused exclusively on integration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV–infected pregnant women with ANC services, four on measures for prevention of mothers to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV infection, and one on HIV care and treatment services for both mother and child. Additionally, two studies discussed the integration of syphilis screening and treatment services with ANC. Only one study described the integration of services during the postnatal care period with ANC services. All of the included studies described integration primarily from the perspective of delivery of services. While the necessity for integration of other health system functions was briefly touched upon in the study by Pfeiffer and others, this was not described as part of the intervention. In the included studies, integrated delivery of services generally entailed delivery of multiple services by the same health care provider or by an integrated care team, with all services provided either within the ANC clinic or otherwise within the same premises as the ANC clinic. However, in one study, only HIV testing and counselling were fully integrated within the ANC service, whereas initiation and follow–up of treatment for HIV–infected women were performed at a separate facility. In the comparison groups, similar services were usually provided as stand–alone services either within the same facility as the ANC clinic or at a nearby health facility. These services could be accessed by referral from the ANC clinic.

Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of the literature of evaluations of interventions for improving paediatric ART adherence.

Search methods: We created a comprehensive search strategy in order to identify all studies relevant to this topic. In July 2010, we searched the following electronic databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, Web of Social Science, NLM Gateway (supplemented by a manual search of the most recent abstracts not included in the Gateway database). We searched abstracts from the International AIDS Conference from 2002 to 2010, the International AIDS Society Conference on Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention from 2003 to 2009, and from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections from 1997 to 2010. We used search strategies determined by the Cochrane Review Group on HIV/AIDS. We also contacted researchers who work in this field and checked reference lists of related systematic reviews and of all included studies.

Selection criteria: Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials of interventions to improve adherence to ART among children and adolescents (age ≤18 years) were included. Studies had to report adherence to ART as an outcome.

Data collection and analysis: After one author performed an initial screening to exclude citations that did not meet the inclusion criteria, two authors did a second screening of those citations that likely met the criteria. For all articles that passed the second screening, full articles were pulled in order to make a final determination. Two authors then extracted data and graded methodological quality independently. Differences were resolved through discussion.

Main results: Four studies met the inclusion criteria. No single intervention was evaluated by more than one trial. Two studies were conducted in low-income countries. Two studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT), and two were non-randomised trials. An RCT of a home-based nursing programme showed a positive effect of the intervention on knowledge and medication refills (p=.002), but no effect on CD4 count and viral load. A second RCT of caregiver medication diaries showed that the intervention group had fewer participants reporting no missed doses compared to the control group (85% vs. 92%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant (p=.08). The intervention had no effect on CD4 percentage or viral load. A non-randomised trial of peer support group therapy for adolescents demonstrated no change in self-reported adherence, yet the percentage of participants with suppressed viral load increased from 30% to 80% (p=.06). The second non-randomised trial found that the percentage of children achieving >80% adherence was no different between children on a lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) regimen compared to children on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase regimen (p=.781). However, the proportion of children achieving virological suppression was significantly greater for children on the LPV/r regimen than for children on the NNRTI-containing regimen (p=.002).

Authors' conclusions: A home-based nursing intervention has the potential to improve ART adherence, but more evidence is needed. Medication diaries do not appear to have an effect on adherence or disease outcomes. Two interventions, an LPV/r-containing regimen and peer support therapy for adolescents, did not demonstrate improvements in adherence, yet demonstrated greater viral load suppression compared to control groups, suggesting a different mechanism for improved health outcomes. Well-designed evaluations of interventions to improve paediatric adherence to ART are needed.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,HIV/AIDS control,NA,NA,Population policies/programmes and reproductive health,Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,STD control including HIV/AIDS,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,ART | Anti-Retroviral Therapy | HIV | AIDS | Child Health | Adolescent Health | Adherence | Medication Adherence | Compliance,NA,Europe and Central Asia,France,High income,No,Liberal democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,None,NA,Government agency,Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC),NA,4,0,0,Antiretroviral therapy (ART),"[""ART adherence programmes""] -- Any intervention or strategy for improving paediatric adherence to antiretroviral regimens. -- Any intervention or strategy for improving paediatric adherence to antiretroviral regimens.

Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV infection among sex workers and their clients in low- and middle-income countries.

Search methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane HIV/AIDS group specialized register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstract International (DAI), EMBASE, LILACS, BIOSIS, SciSearch, INDMED, Proquest, and various South Asian abstracting databases were included in the database list. The publication sites of the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other international research and non-governmental organizations also appeared in the database list.

Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs examining the effects on HIV transmission risk of different behavioral interventions or comparing behavioral interventions with no intervention, where described any one of the outcome measures, such as HIV incidence and prevalence, STI incidence and prevalence, change in self-reported of condom use, and other HIV-related outcome.

Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trials, extracted data and assessed the risk bias. Heterogeneity amongst trials was also tested.

Main results: A total of 13 trials with 8,698 participants were included. Primary outcomes (HIV and STI prevalence and incidence) were reported in seven trials. Of these, HIV incidence was reported in only three trials. After a 6-month follow-up assessment, there was no evidence that social cognitive behavioral intervention was effective in reducing HIV incidence (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.22). However, there was a reduction in HIV incidence at 3-month follow-up assessment of promotion of female and male condom (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.38). Social cognitive interventions and promotion of female and male condom use were significantly reduced STIs incidence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96) and (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88), respectively. Secondary outcomes were identified in 13 trials. Meta-analyses showed evidence that interventions to promote the use of female and male condoms do reduce non-condom use (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.05) compared to promotion of male condoms alone, and that social cognitive interventions reduced drug use among sex workers (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.16) compared to standard care.

Authors' conclusions: Available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention, behavioral interventions are effective in reducing HIV and the incidence of STIs amongst female sex workers (FSWs). Given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing HIV/STI and the public health need to control transmission amongst FSWs, there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions. However, it should be recognized that there is a lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations, and that all of the trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,HIV/AIDS control,Social development and protection,Other excluded groups,Population policies/programmes and reproductive health,Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,STD control including HIV/AIDS,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Equity sensitive analytical framework | Intervention targets vulnerable population,Other | Sex,"Sex (includes the use of the term gender meaning the biological sex of a person)

Findings We identified one cluster-randomized control trial and 22 quasi-experimental studies. All of the included interventions targeted poor women living in low- or middle-income countries.

The results of the higher quality studies indicated an association between membership of a microfinance scheme and improvements in the health of women and their children. The observed improvements included reduced maternal and infant mortality, better sexual health and, in some cases, lower levels of interpersonal violence. According to the results of the few studies in which changes in empowerment were measured, membership of the relatively large and well-established microfinance schemes generally led to increased empowerment but this did not necessarily translate into improved health outcomes. Qualitative evidence suggested that increased empowerment may have contributed to observed improvements in contraceptive use and mental well-being and reductions in the risk of violence from an intimate partner.

It involves the formation of women’s groups for saving and credit, training and skills development, functional literacy – including legal and social awareness – and technical and marketing support. Money saved by a group is used to make loans to group members to support income-generation activities such as cottage industries and goat rearing. Sometimes these elements are combined with so-called bolt-on public health components such as the promotion of maternal and child health or family planning. The main aims of the scheme are to reduce women’s economic dependence on men, strengthen their positions within their families, draw them into the public sphere and expose them to new ideas and education. The theory is that the scheme may influence health in many different ways – e.g. it may increase demand for family planning services and reduce the social costs of fertility regulation, leading to fewer, healthier children and better maternal health. It may also lead to improvements in the care and nutrition of children and so reduce child mortality in general and, particularly, the high rates recorded among girls.

This is based on the belief that healthcare professionals are prompted to modify their practice when given performance feedback showing that their clinical practice is inconsistent with a desirable target. Despite its prevalence as a quality improvement strategy, there remains uncertainty regarding both the e,ectiveness of audit and feedback in improving healthcare practice and the characteristics of audit and feedback that lead to greater impact. Objectives: To assess the e,ects of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals and patient outcomes and to examine factors that may explain variation in the e,ectiveness of audit and feedback. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010, Issue 4, part of The Cochrane Library. www.thecochranelibrary.com, including the Cochrane E,ective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register (searched 10 December 2010); MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 to November Week 3 2010) (searched 09 December 2010); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to 2010 Week 48) (searched 09 December 2010); CINAHL, Ebsco (1981 to present) (searched 10 December 2010); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Science (1975 to present) (searched 12-15 September 2011). Selection criteria: Randomised trials of audit and feedback (defined as a summary of clinical performance over a specified period of time) that reported objectively measured health professional practice or patient outcomes. In the case of multifaceted interventions, only trials in which audit and feedback was considered the core, essential aspect of at least one intervention arm were included.Data collection and analysis: All data were abstracted by two independentreview authors. Forthe primary outcome(s) in each study, we calculated the median absolute risk di,erence (RD) (adjusted for baseline performance) of compliance with desired practice compliance for dichotomous outcomes and the median percent change relative to the control group for continuous outcomes. Across studies the median e,ect size was weighted by number of health professionals involved in each study. We investigated the following factors as possible explanations for the variation in the effectiveness of interventions across comparisons: format of feedback, source of feedback, frequency of feedback, instructions for improvement, direction of change required, baseline performance, profession of recipient, and risk of bias within the trial itself. We also conducted exploratory analyses to assess the role of context and the targeted clinical behaviour. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual, and qualitative analyses were undertaken to examine variation in effect size related to these factors. Main results: We included and analysed 140 studies for this review. In the main analyses, a total of 108 comparisons from 70 studies compared any intervention in which audit and feedback was a core, essential component to usual care and evaluated e,ects on professional practice. Afer excluding studies at high risk of bias, there were 82 comparisons from 49 studies featuring dichotomous outcomes, and the weighted median adjusted RD was a 4.3% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5% to 16%) absolute increase in healthcare professionals' compliance with desired practice. Across 26 comparisons from 21 studies with continuous outcomes, the weighted median adjusted percent change relative to control was 1.3% (IQR = 1.3% to 28.9%). For patient outcomes, the weighted median RD was -0.4% (IQR -1.3% to 1.6%) for 12 comparisons from six studies reporting dichotomous outcomes and the weighted median percentage change was 17% (IQR 1.5% to 17%) for eight comparisons from five studies reporting continuous outcomes. Multivariable meta-regression indicated that feedback may be more effective when baseline performance is low, the source is a supervisor or colleague, it is provided more than once, it is delivered in both verbal and written formats, and when it includes both explicit targets and an action plan. In addition, the e,ect size varied based on the clinical behaviour targeted by the intervention. Authors' conclusions: Audit and feedback generally leads to small but potentially important improvements in professional practice. The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to depend on baseline performance and how the feedback is provided.

Numerous prevention strategies such as health education, skills-building and improving accessibility to contraceptives have been employed by countries across the world, in an effort to address this problem. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effects of these intervention, and hence the need to review their evidence-base. Objectives: To assess the effects of primary prevention interventions (school-based, community/home-based, clinic-based, and faith-based) on unintended pregnancies among adolescents. Search strategy: We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE) ending December 2008. Cross-referencing, hand-searching, and contacting experts yielded additional citations. Selection criteria: We included both individual and cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any interventions that aimed to increase knowledge and attitudes relating to risk of unintended pregnancies, promote delay in the initiation of sexual intercourse and encourage consistent use of birth control methods to reduce unintended pregnancies in adolescents aged 10-19 years. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias in studies that met the inclusion criteria. Where appropriate, binary outcomes were pooled using random effects model with a 95% confidence interval (Cl).  Main results: Forty one RCTs that enrolled 95,662 adolescents were included. Participants were ethnically diverse. Eleven studies randomized individuals, twenty seven randomized clusters (schools (19), classrooms (5), and communities/neighbourhoods (3). Three studies were mixed (individually and cluster randomized). The length of follow up varied from 3 months to 4.5 years. Data could only be pooled for a number of studies (15) because of variations in the reporting of outcomes. Results showed that multiple interventions (combination of educational and contraceptive interventions) lowered the rate of unintended pregnancy among adolescents. Evidence on the possible effects of interventions on secondary outcomes (initiation of sexual intercourse, use of birth control methods, abortion, childbirth, sexually transmitted diseases) is not coclusive.Methodological strengths included a relatively large sample size and statistical control for baseline differences, while limitations included lack of biological outcomes, possible self-report bias, analysis neglecting clustered randomization and the use of different statistical test in reporting outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Combination of educational and contraceptive interventions appears to reduce unintended pregnancy among adolescents. Evidence for program effects on biological measures is limited.

Recent epidemiological data, for example, show that waterpipe smoking has become the most prevalent tobacco use method among adolescents in the EMR, and the second most prevalent in the US. Waterpipes are used socially, often being shared between friends or family at home, or in dedicated bars and cafes that provide waterpipes to patrons. Because the smoke passes through a reservoir of water, waterpipe tobacco smoking is perceived as being less harmful than other methods of tobacco use. At least in some cultures, women and girls are more likely to use a waterpipe than to use other forms of tobacco, and it is popular among younger smokers. Accumulating evidence suggests that some waterpipe smokers become addicted, have difficulty quitting, and experience similar health risks as cigarette smokers. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions for waterpipe users. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register in June 2015. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL , using variant terms and spellings ('waterpipe' or 'narghile' or 'arghile' or 'shisha' or 'goza' or 'narkeela' or 'hookah' or 'hubble bubble'). We searched for trials, published or unpublished, in any language, and especially in regions where waterpipe use is widespread. Selection criteria: We sought randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers of any age or gender. The primary outcome of interest was abstinence from tobacco use, measured at six months post-cessation or longer, regardless of whether abstinence was biochemically verified. We included interventions that were pharmacological (for example, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion) or behavioural, or both, and could be directed at individual waterpipe users or at groups of users. We only included tobacco cessation interventions, and did not consider trials of prevention of uptake. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors assessed abstracts of the studies retrieved by the search strategy, for possible inclusion in the review. We retrieved full-text articles for all abstracts that any of the authors believed might be suitable. Two review authors then extracted data and assessed trial quality independently in accordance with standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies. We aimed to pool groups of studies that we considered to be sufficiently similar, provided there was no evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity, and aimed to estimate a pooled risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we presented summary and descriptive statistics. Main results: Our search retrieved 1311 unique citations, of which 1289 were excluded after title and abstract screening. Of the remaining 22, we excluded 19 because they were empirical studies that were not randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials (n = 12), because they were review articles (n = 3), because they described protocols only (n = 2), they were conducted among cigarette smokers only (n = 1), or they had only a three-month follow-up (n = 1).We identified three controlled trials which tested cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers. Studies were carried out in Egypt (Mohlman 2013), Pakistan (Dogar 2014), and the US (Lipkus 2011). One was a randomized controlled trial and two were cluster-randomized trials. Two studies tested individual-level interventions, and one tested a community-level intervention. Two studies included only behavioural interventions, and one study (Dogar 2014) included two intervention groups: one behavioural, and the other behavioural with bupropion. The Lipkus and Mohlman studies delivered waterpipe-specific interventions, and the Dogar study delivered a non-specific tobacco intervention. Due to study variation we did not pool results, and intervention effects are reported descriptively. Compared to control groups, waterpipe smoking cessation rates were higher in the intervention groups in all three studies, with a significant difference in two studies. For the Dogar study, the RRs for waterpipe smoking abstinence at 25 weeks among waterpipe-only smokers were 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 3.8; 180 participants) in the behavioural group, and 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.7; 84 participants) in the behavioural plus bupropion group. In our analysis we have combined both groups, to give a RR of 2.28 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.83; 200 participants). The Mohlman study delivered a RR in male waterpipe-smokers at one year in favour of the intervention of 3.25 (95% CI 1.19 to 8.89). Authors' conclusions: Although the literature on waterpipe cessation interventions remains sparse, the reviewed studies provide a basis for developing interventions in this area. The lack of statistically significant effects in one of the three studies is not unexpected, given the small and pilot nature of the studies. The studies highlight important design and content issues that need to be considered for future cessation trials in waterpipe smokers.

Aims: To synthesise what is known globally about effective interventions to reduce mental illness-based stigma and discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Method: We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact. Results: Eighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and -0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies. Conclusions: There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes. Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in the medium to long term.

Two studies assessed IUD insertion by nurses compared to doctors, two assessed IUD insertion by auxiliary nurse-midwives compared to doctors, one assessed tubal ligation by midwives compared to doctors, and one assessed the delivery of vasectomy by medical students compared to doctors. In general, little or no difference was found in contraceptive outcomes between cadres.

Advocacy may contribute to reducing abuse, empowering women to improve their situation by providing informal counselling and support for safety planning and increasing access to different services. Advocacy may be a stand-alone service, accepting referrals from healthcare providers, or part of a multi-component (and possibly multi-agency) intervention provided by service staff or others. Objectives: To assess the effects of advocacy interventions within or outside healthcare settings in women who have experienced intimate partner abuse. Search methods: In April 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 10 other databases. We also searched WHO ICTRP, mRCT, and UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN), and examined relevant websites and reference lists with forward citation tracking of included studies. For the original review we handsearched six key journals. We also contacted first authors of eligible papers and experts in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing advocacy interventions for women with experience of intimate partner abuse versus no intervention or usual care (if advocacy was minimal and fewer than 20% of women received it). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and undertook data extraction. We contacted authors for missing information needed to calculate statistics for the review and looked for adverse events. Main results: We included 13 trials involving 2141 participants aged 15 to 65 years, frequently having low socioeconomic status.The studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of methodology, study processes and design, including with regard to the duration of follow-up (postintervention to three years), although this was not associated with differences in effect. The studies also had considerable clinical heterogeneity in relation to staff delivering advocacy; setting (community, shelter, antenatal, healthcare); advocacy intensity (from 30 minutes to 80 hours); and abuse severity. Three trials evaluated advocacy within multi-component interventions. Eleven measured some form of abuse (eight scales), six assessed quality of life (three scales), and six measured depression (three scales). Countries and ethnic groups varied (one or more minority ethnic groups in the USA or UK, and local populations in Hong Kong and Peru). Setting was associated with intensity and duration of advocacy.Risk of bias was high in five studies, moderate in five, and low in three. The quality of evidence (considering multiple factors such as risk of bias, study size, missing data) was moderate to low for brief advocacy and very low for intensive advocacy. Incidence of abuse Physical abuseModerate quality pooled data from two healthcare studies (moderate risk of bias) and one community study (low risk of bias), all with 12-month follow-up data, showed no effect on physical abuse for brief (< 12 hours) advocacy interventions (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.17 to 0.16; n = 558). One antenatal study (low risk of bias) showed an association between brief advocacy and reduced minor physical abuse at one year (mean difference (MD) change - 1.00, 95% CI - 1.82 to - 0.18; n = 110). An antenatal, multi-component study showed a greater likelihood of physical abuse ending (odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.75) immediately after advocacy (number needed to treat (NNT) = 8); we cannot exclude impact from other components.Low to very low quality evidence from two intensive advocacy trials (12 hours plus duration) showed reduced severe physical abuse in women leaving a shelter at 24 months (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.77; NNT = 8), but not at 12 or 36 months. Sexual abuseMeta-analysis of two studies (n = 239) showed no effect of advocacy on sexual abuse (SMD - 0.12, 95% CI - 0.37 to 0.14), agreeing with the change score (MD - 0.07, 95% CI - 0.30 to 0.16) from a third study and the OR (0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.12) from a fourth antenatal, multi-component study. Emotional abuseOne study in antenatal care, rated at low risk of bias, showed reduced emotional abuse at ≤ 12-month follow-up (MD (change score) - 4.24, 95% CI - 6.42 to - 2.06; n = 110). Psychosocial health Quality of lifeMeta-analysis of two studies (high risk of bias) showed intensive advocacy slightly improved overall quality of life of women recruited from shelters (MD 0.23, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.46; n = 343) at 12-month follow-up, with greater improvement in perceived physical quality of life from a primary care study (high risk of bias; MD 4.90, 95% CI 0.98 to 8.82) immediately postintervention. Depression Meta-analysis of two studies in healthcare settings, one at high risk of bias and one at moderate risk, showed that fewer women developed depression (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.65; n = 149; NNT = 4) with brief advocacy. One study at high risk of bias reported a slight reduction in depression in pregnant women immediately after the intervention (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.29; n = 103; NNT = 8).There was no evidence that intensive advocacy reduced depression at ≤ 12-month follow-up (MD - 0.14, 95% CI - 0.33 to 0.05; 3 studies; n = 446) or at two years (SMD - 0.12, 95% CI - 0.36 to 0.12; 1 study; n = 265). Adverse effectsTwo women died, one who was murdered by her partner and one who committed suicide. No evidence links either death to study participation. Authors' conclusions: Results suggest some benefits from advocacy. However, most studies were underpowered. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity largely precluded pooling of trials. Therefore, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of benefit, the impact of abuse severity, and the setting.Based on the evidence reviewed, intensive advocacy may improve short-term quality of life and reduce physical abuse one to two years after the intervention for women recruited from domestic violence shelters or refuges. Brief advocacy may provide small short-term mental health benefits and reduce abuse, particularly in pregnant women and for less severe abuse.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Gender,Human development and gender,Adolescent health,Health,Non_communicable diseases (NCDs),Promotion of mental health and well-being,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,The intervention is aiming to address violence against women which can be a part f gender discrimination but it does not  discuss equity or inequality.,Domestic Violence | Spousal Abuse | Physical Abuse | Sexual Abuse | Emotional Abuse | Depression,NA,North America,United States,High income,No,NA,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,"They analysed a lot of different measures for the same outcomes, so extracted what they considered their main analysis.",NA,Academic institution,National Institute For Health Research (NIHR),NA,13,Not reported,Not reported,Support to community justice advocates,"[""Intensive advocacy""] -- Any intervention that included intensive advocacy for women who experience intimate partner violence -- Interventions to improve the health consequences for women who have experienced intimate partner abuse: 1) intensive (12 or more hours) advocacy intervention; 2) brief (less than 12 hours) Pg 11",IPV incidence,Physical abuse - pg 4,NA,NA,Whole population,NA,NA,265,Low quality of evidence (GRADE).,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,NA,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not applicable,1,Not reported,Not reported,NA,NA,NA,We are in the process of completing a summary for this review.

Humanitarian agencies and governments are increasingly challenged with how to effectively tackle NCDs. Reviewing the evidence of interventions for NCDs in humanitarian crises can help guide future policies and research by identifying effective interventions and evidence gaps. The aim of this paper is to systematically review evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting NCDs during humanitarian crises in LMICs. Methods: A systematic review methodology was followed using PRISMA standards. Studies were selected on NCD interventions with civilian populations affected by humanitarian crises in low- and middle-income countries. Five bibliographic databases and a range of grey literature sources were searched. Descriptive analysis was applied and a quality assessment conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for experimental studies. Results: The search yielded 4919 references of which 8 studies met inclusion criteria. Seven of the 8 studies were observational, and one study was a non-blinded randomised-controlled trial. Diseases examined included hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, thalassaemia, and arthritis. Study settings included locations in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and South Asia. Interventions featuring disease-management protocols and/or cohort monitoring demonstrated the strongest evidence of effectiveness. No studies examined intervention costs. The quality of studies was limited, with a reliance on observational study designs, limited use of control groups, biases associated with missing data and inadequate patient-follow-up, and confounding was poorly addressed. Conclusions: The review highlights the extremely limited quantity and quality of evidence on this topic. Interventions that incorporate standardisation and facilitate patient follow-up appear beneficial.

Interventions delivered by mobile phone have been demonstrated to be eGective in other health areas, but their eGects on use of contraception have not been established. Objectives To assess the eGects of mobile phone-based interventions for improving contraception use. Search methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of client-provider interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve contraception use compared with standard care or another intervention. We searched the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, POPLINE, Africa-Wide Information and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from January 1993 to October 2014, as well as clinical trials registries, online mHealth resources and abstracts from key conferences. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of mobile phone-based interventions to improve any form of contraception use amongst users or potential users of contraception. Outcome measures included uptake of contraception, measures of adherence, pregnancy and abortion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of studies retrieved using the search strategy and extracted data from the includedstudies.We calculatedtheMantel-Haenszelrisk ratio (RR)fordichotomous outcomes andthemeandiGerence (MD)for continuous outcomes,together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).DiGerences in interventions and outcome measures did not permit us to undertake meta-analysis. Main results Five RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Three trials aimed to improve adherence to a specific method of contraception amongst existing or new contraception users by comparing automated text message interventions versus standard care. Two trials aimed to improve both uptake and adherence, not limited to one method, in both users and non-users of contraception. No trials were at low risk of bias in all areas assessed One trial in the USA reported improved self reported oral contraceptive (OC) continuation at six months from an intervention comprising a range of uni-directional and interactive text messages (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35).One trial in Cambodia reported increased selfreported use of eGective contraception at four months post abortion from an intervention comprising automated interactive voice messages and phone counsellor support (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.66). One feasibility trial in the USA reported a lower mean number of days between scheduled and completed attendance for the first but not subsequent Depo-Provera appointments using clinic records from an intervention comprising reminders and healthy self management text messages (mean diGerence (MD) -8.60 days, 95% CI -16.74 to -0.46). Simple text message OC reminders had no eGect on missed pills as assessed by electronic medication monitoring in a smalltrial in theUSA (MD0.5 missed pills, 95% CI-1.08 to 2.08).No eGect on selfreported contraception use was noted amongstisotretinoin users from an intervention that provided health information via two uni-directionaltext messages and mail (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.89). One trial assessed potential adverse eGects of the intervention and reported no evidence of road traGic accidents or domestic abuse. Authors' conclusions Our review provides limited evidence that interventions delivered by mobile phone can improve contraception use. Whilst evidence suggests that a series of interactive voice messages and counsellor support can improve post-abortion contraception, and that a mixture of uni-directional and interactive daily educational text messages can improve OC adherence, the cost-eGectiveness and long-term eGects of these interventions remain unknown. Further high-quality trials are required to robustly establish the eGects of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve contraception use.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Health service delivery,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Health,Basic Health,Basic health care,Health,Basic Health,Health education,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Sub-group analysis by sex,Sex,Presents some sex-disaggregated outcomes and briefly touches on how contraception use can be more transformative for women.,Text Message | Oral Contraceptive | Reminders | Depo-Provera | Condom,NA,North America,United States,High income,No,NA,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,None.,NA,Not specified,Not Specified,NA,5,Not reported,Not reported,mHealth,"[""Voice messages and counsellor support""] -- Voice messages and counselor support for appropriate contraception use -- Types of interventions We included studies that examined any type of client-provider intervention delivered by mobile phone designed to improve use of contraception compared with standard delivery of care or another intervention.

Policy makers and service providers aiming to reduce children's disruptive behavior problems must often choose between importing an intervention developed abroad or instead developing or using a ""homegrown"" (i.e., local) intervention. No comprehensive comparison of these interventions exists. Method: We performed a multilevel meta-regression of 129 randomized trials (374 effect sizes) of transported and homegrown parenting interventions. We identified trials by searching the included trials lists of systematic reviews, found through searches in 6 databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Trials that had not yet been reviewed were found by searching the same databases. Primary outcome was the mean difference in effectiveness between transported and homegrown interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior. We also compared this differential effectiveness for various intervention ""brands"" (e.g., Incredible Years and Triple P Positive Parenting Program) and geographical regions (e.g., North America and Europe). Results: Transported and homegrown interventions did not differ in their effectiveness to reduce disruptive child behavior (d = 0.10, not significant). Results were robust across intervention brands and geographical regions. Six trials on transported interventions in Hong Kong, Iran, and Panama suggest promising results for transporting interventions to ""nonwestern"" countries, whereas one trial in Indonesia does not.

It is estimated that about 80% of CVD deaths occur in LMICs. People in LMICs are more exposed to cardiovascular risk factors such as tobacco, and oFen do not have access to eGective and equitable healthcare services (including early detection services). Evidence from high-income countries indicates that multiple risk factor intervention programmes do not result in reductions in CVD events. Given the increasing incidence of CVDs and lower CVD health awareness in LMICs it is possible that such programmes may have beneficial eGects. Objectives To determine the eGectiveness of multiple risk factorinterventions (with or without pharmacologicaltreatment) aimed at modifying major cardiovascular risk factors for the primary prevention of CVD in LMICs. Search methods We searched (from inception to 27 June 2014) the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, HTA, DARE, EED), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and three other databases on 27 June 2014.We also searched two clinicaltrialregisters and conducted reference checking to identify additional studies. We applied no language limits. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of health promotion interventions to achieve behaviour change (i.e. smoking cessation, dietary advice, increasing activity levels) with or without pharmacological treatments, which aim to alter more than one cardiovascular risk factor (i.e. diet, reduce blood pressure, smoking, total blood cholesterol or increase physical activity) of at least six months duration of follow-up conducted in LMICs. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean diGerences (MDs), and presented all results with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease events. Main results Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias. Some studies were at high risk of bias for random sequence generation (two trials), allocation concealment (two trials), blinding of outcome assessors (one trial) and incomplete outcome data (one trial). Duration and content of multiple risk factor interventions varied across the trials. Two trials recruited healthy participants and the other 11 trials recruited people with varying risks of CVD, such as participants with known hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Only one study reported CVD outcomes and multiple risk factor interventions did not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.07, 232 participants, low-quality evidence); the result is imprecise (a wide confidence interval and small sample size) and makes it diGicult to draw a reliable conclusion. None of the included trials reported all-cause mortality. The pooled eGect indicated a reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -6.72 mmHg, 95% CI -9.82 to -3.61, I2 = 91%, 4868 participants, low-quality evidence), diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.40 mmHg, 95% CI -6.47 to -2.34, I2 = 92%, 4701 participants, lowquality evidence), body mass index (MD -0.76 kg/m2, 95% CI -1.29 to -0.22, I2 = 80%, 2984 participants, low-quality evidence) and waist circumference (MD -3.31, 95% CI -4.77 to -1.86, I2 = 55%, 393 participants, moderate-quality evidence) in favour of multiple risk factor interventions, but there was substantial heterogeneity. There was insuGicient evidence to determine the eGect of these interventions on consumption of fruit or vegetables, smoking cessation, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol. None of the included trials reported on adverse events. Authors' conclusions Due to the limited evidence currently available, we can draw no conclusions as to the eGectiveness of multiple risk factor interventions on combined CVD events and mortality. There is some evidence that multiple risk factor interventions may lower blood pressure levels, body mass index and waist circumference in populations in LMIC settings at high risk of hypertension and diabetes. There was considerable heterogeneity between the trials, the trials were small, and at some risk of bias.

This review sets out to take a fresh look and to generate sound evidence on the relationship between property regime and resource use in the use of renewable natural resources (RNRs). Its seeks to make a novel contribution to the existing large body of research on the topic by (a) assessing the available knowledge in a systematic fashion and (b) focusing on studies involving direct comparisons between different access regimes and reporting key outcomes.

A total of 19 studies reported relevant outcomes on the comparison between controlled and open access. Only two studies included data on all three outcomes. At the same time, 14 out of the 19 studies reported an improvement overall in at least one important outcome with no negative outcomes under controlled access in comparison with open access. Seventeen studies reported data related to sustainability effects. This is the highest reporting rate among all questions and types of outcomes, amounting to 49 per cent of all included studies and 89 per cent of all studies comparing controlled and open access. Fifteen studies found that resource use is more sustainable under controlled access than open access. For example, Cinner et al. (2006) found that fish average size and fish biomass were higher in fishing areas of Indonesia and Papa New Guinea with periodic closures than outside those. Nagendra et al. (2008) reported that forest land under controlled access in Nepal included a larger percentage of stable forest area, larger patches of stable forest and lower percentage of stable non-forest area. Seven studies compared controlled and open access resource use in terms of its effects on poverty alleviation. Four of them concluded that resource use is more pro-poor under controlled access. For example, Haller and Merten (2008) showed in their historical analysis of changes in resource property and use in Zambia that access controls allowed local people to keep outsiders out and benefit from local fisheries in the past, something that is no longer possible in the absence of access controls today. Castello (2009) produced insights from Brazil showing that mean annual income from a local fishery more than doubled and fishing families‟ purchasing power doubled within 5-6 years with the implementation of access controls. Only two studies examine the profitability of resource use in a comparative manner. Both suggest that resource use is more profitable under controlled than open access. Den Hertog and Wiersum (2000) report from Nepal that resource use produces higher yields of a particular high-value non-timber forest product, and that product collection is more efficient under controlled access than open access. McClanahan (2010) derive that per capita revenues and net income increased after the imposition of access controls in Kenyan fisheries.

It is often argued that unlimited access to natural resources can lead to their over-exploitation. Ways to address this tragedy of the commons include the introduction of mechanisms to limit the use of these resources (closed access); or changes in property regimes to regulate private ownership (where rights to renewable natural resources are individual and transferable); or the institution of common property (where rights are shared and subject to collective-use regulations). These can contribute to sustainable use and a more 'societal' management of natural resources by aligning resource users and societal interest. In forestry, examples of controlled-access mechanisms include forestland allocation and forest devolution. In fisheries, a common approach is the allocation of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) involving transfer groups and common property. However, little is known about how these property reforms affect the sustainability and profitability of the use of these renewable natural resources in developing countries, nor their actual impact on poor communities.","To synthesise and assess the evidence on whether the use of renewable natural resources in fisheries and forestry is more sustainable, pro-poor and profitable under controlled or open access conditions, and under common-property or private- ownership conditions.",We are in the process of completing a summary for this review. Please check back later,"The authors included 35 studies from Asia, Latin America and Africa (and one study from Europe) assessing the management of renewable natural resources in fisheries and forestry under a range of property regimes and access conditions.","The results suggest that controlled access (exclusive access to natural resources by a specified group of beneficiaries) improves the sustainability of these resources (especially for fisheries). However, this effect is not automatic, as there were instances where restricting access did not improve the sustainability of these resources. The review additionally found that controlled access can contribute to poverty alleviation when the resource benefits are distributed among the local population. The authors failed to find any significant difference in terms of profitability of resource use under controlled access compared with open access; however, these findings were based on only a small number of studies. The authors point out that controlled access is not synonymous with privatisation and can be instituted under common-property as well as private-ownership conditions. The review found mixed results when comparing the effects of private property and common ownership on sustainability and poverty-reduction outcomes. Neither approach was found to be unequivocally superior. Nonetheless, the authors note that common-property regimes appear to enhance sustainability more effectively than private ownership does. The authors conclude that controlled access under common-property regimes is a superior scheme for achieving poverty reduction and sustainability of renewable natural resources. While all results were found to be robust to the exclusion of low-quality studies from the analysis, the authors acknowledge that the quality of the evidence is overall not very high, and that therefore the results of the review need to be viewed with caution.","Finally, the authors highlight the need for further research, using more rigorous study designs and disaggregation of impacts for different groups of poor people.","The authors included primary studies comparing the use of renewable natural resources of forests and fisheries, in developing countries and transitional economies, under controlled-access and open-access conditions, and/or under common-property and private-ownership conditions.

However, many women living with HIV are hesitant to disclose their HIV status due to fear of negative outcomes such as violence, abandonment, relationship dissolution and stigma. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating interventions to facilitate safer disclosure of HIV status for women living with HIV who experience or fear violence. Articles, conference abstracts and programme reports were included if they reported post-intervention evaluation results and were published before 1 April 2015. Searching was conducted through electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles and conference abstracts, reviewing websites of relevant organizations for grey literature, hand searching reference lists of included studies and contacting experts. Systematic methods were used for screening and data abstraction, which was conducted in duplicate. Study quality (rigor) was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Two interventions met the inclusion criteria: the Safe Homes and Respect for Everyone cluster-randomized trial of combination HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) services in Rakai, Uganda, and the South Africa HIV/AIDS Antenatal Post-Test Support study individual randomized trial of an enhanced counselling intervention for pregnant women undergoing HIV testing and counselling. Both programmes integrated screening for IPV into HIV testing services and trained counsellors to facilitate discussions about disclosure based on a woman’s risk of violence. However, both were implemented as part of multiple-component interventions, making it impossible to isolate the impact of the safer disclosure components.

Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions tailored to address identified barriers to change on professional practice or patient outcomes. Search methods For this update, in addition to the EPOC Register and pending files, we searched the following databases without language restrictions, from inception until August 2007: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BNI and HMIC. We searched the National Research Register to November 2007.  We undertook further searches to October 2009 to identify potentially eligible published or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified barriers to change that reported objectively measured professional practice or healthcare outcomes in which at least one group received an intervention designed to address prospectively identified barriers to change. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed quality and extracted data. We undertook quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analyses had two elements. 1. We carried out a meta‐regression to compare interventions tailored to address identified barriers to change with either no interventions or an intervention(s) not tailored to the barriers. 2. We carried out heterogeneity analyses to investigate sources of differences in the effectiveness of interventions. These included the effects of: risk of bias, concealment of allocation, rigour of barrier analysis, use of theory, complexity of interventions, and the reported presence of administrative constraints. Main results We included 26 studies comparing an intervention tailored to address identified barriers to change to no intervention or an intervention(s) not tailored to the barriers. The effect sizes of these studies varied both across and within studies. Twelve studies provided enough data to be included in the quantitative analysis. A meta‐regression model was fitted adjusting for baseline odds by fitting it as a covariate, to obtain the pooled odds ratio of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.16 to 2.01) from Bayesian analysis and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.82, P < 0.001) from classical analysis. The heterogeneity analyses found that no study attributes investigated were significantly associated with effectiveness of the interventions.

Barriers may be identified by various methods, including observation, focus group discussions, interviews or surveys of the involved healthcare professionals, and/or through an analysis of the organisation or system in which care is provided. We excluded studies that used gap analysis only (i.e. audits identifying a gap between actual and desired performance), as well as studies of educational interventions based on an identified lack of knowledge and designed to improve knowledge only. The identification of barriers must have been undertaken before the design and delivery of the intervention. If the timing of the identification of barriers was not clear, we contacted the study authors for clarification. Studies had to involve a comparison group that did not receive a tailored intervention (including either no intervention or an intervention not tailored to identified barriers), or a comparison between an intervention that was targeted at both individual and social or organisational barriers, compared with an intervention targeted at only individual barriers.

Chronic diseases associated with physical inactivity include cancer, diabetes and coronary heart disease. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence of the eGectiveness of school-based interventions in promoting physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents. Search methods The search strategy included searching several databases. In addition, reference lists of included articles and background papers were reviewed for potentially relevant studies, as well as references from relevant Cochrane reviews. Primary authors of included studies were contacted as needed for additional information. Selection criteria To be included, the intervention had to be relevant to public health practice, implemented, facilitated, or promoted by staG in local public health units, implemented in a school setting and aimed at increasing physical activity, report on outcomes for children and adolescents (aged 6 to 18 years), and use a prospective design with a control group. Data collection and analysis Standardized tools were used by two independent reviewers to rate each study’s methodological quality and for data extraction. Where discrepancies existed discussion occurred until consensus was reached. The results were summarized narratively due to wide variations in the populations, interventions evaluated and outcomes measured. Main results 13,841 titles were identified and screened and 482 articles were retrieved. Multiple publications on the same project were combined and counted as one project, resulting in 395 distinct project accounts (studies). Of the 395 studies 104 were deemed relevant and of those, four were assessed as having strong methodological quality, 22 were of moderate quality and 78 were considered weak. In total 26 studies were included in the review. There is good evidence that school-based physical activity interventions have a positive impact on four of the nine outcome measures. Specifically positive eGects were observed for duration of physical activity, television viewing, VO2 max, and blood cholesterol. Generally school-based interventions had no effect on leisure time physical activity rates, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and pulse rate. At a minimum, a combination of printed educational materials and changes to the school curriculum that promote physical activity result in positive effects.

Generally the interventions focused on providing students with information about the benefits of physical activity and healthy nutrition, the risks associated with inactivity and unhealthy food choices, and increasing the amount of time students were engaged in physical activity during the school day, as well as ensuring they expended greater amounts of energy during physical activity sessions. The interventions targeted school curriculum (related to physical education classes specifically and whole curriculum generally), teacher training, educational materials, changes to the format of the school day, and accessibility to exercise equipment. Interventions included: training sessions for teachers (to learn more eGective ways to promote physical activity and to incorporate it into curricula); training materials including kits, packages of materials to be used in curricula and materials to be given to students and parents. Packages included teaching notes on exercise, how the body works, healthy eating and nutrition. They also targeted physical education classes by increasing the level of activity students engaged in during these classes, introduced activities more geared to the age and level of development of the child, and put greater emphasis on games. Students were also encouraged to be more active outside of school during leisure time. The curriculum focused on creating a positive self-image through awareness of physical activity benefits. Curriculum changes were also implemented in other courses, such as Science, where discussions of healthy eating and physical activity were incorporated. Some interventions also included changes to the food provided in school cafeterias so as to increase the number of healthy food choices. Other strategies included a risk factor assessment of students to identify students with established risk factors and develop a plan to reduce their risk through increased physical activity, healthy nutrition and goal attainment. (p.4) The range of interventions included changes to school curriculum, changes in schoolroutines to increase time spent by students being physically active, increase in the time students engaged in vigorous physical activity during physical education classes, provision of equipment, training for teachers in incorporating physical activity into school curriculum and routines, and educational materials for teachers, students and parents.

Intervention studies which have assessed the health impacts of housing improvements are an important data resource to test assumptions about the potential for health improvement. Evaluations may not detect long term health impacts due to limited follow-up periods. Impacts on socio-economic determinants of health may be a valuable proxy indication of the potential for longer term health impacts. To assess the health and social impacts on residents following improvements to the physical fabric of housing. Twenty seven academic and grey literature bibliographic databases were searched for housing intervention studies from 1887 to July 2012 (ASSIA; Avery Index; CAB Abstracts; The Campbell Library; CINAHL; The Cochrane Library; COPAC; DH-DATA: Health Admin; EMBASE; Geobase; Global Health; IBSS; ICONDA; MEDLINE; MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; NTIS; PAIS; PLANEX; PsycINFO; RIBA; SCIE; Sociological Abstracts; Social Science Citations Index; Science Citations Index expanded; SIGLE; SPECTR). Twelve Scandinavian grey literature and policy databases (Libris; SveMed+; Libris uppsök; DIVA; Artikelsök; NORART; DEFF; AKF; DSI; SBI; Statens Institut for Folkesundhed; Social.dk) and 23 relevant websites were searched. In addition, a request to topic experts was issued for details of relevant studies. Searches were not restricted by language or publication status. Studies which assessed change in any health outcome following housing improvement were included. This included experimental studies and uncontrolled studies. Cross-sectional studies were excluded as correlations are not able to shed light on changes in outcomes. Studies reporting only socio-economic outcomes or indirect measures of health, such as health service use, were excluded. All housing improvements which involved a physical improvement to the fabric of the house were included. Excluded interventions were improvements to mobile homes; modifications for mobility or medical reasons; air quality; lead removal; radon exposure reduction; allergen reduction or removal; and furniture or equipment. Where an improvement included one of these in addition to an included intervention the study was included in the review. Studies were not excluded on the basis of date, location, or language. Studies were independently screened and critically appraised by two review authors. Study quality was assessed using the risk of bias tool and the Hamilton tool to accommodate non-experimental and uncontrolled studies. Health and socio-economic impact data were extracted by one review author and checked by a second review author. Studies were grouped according to broad intervention categories, date, and context before synthesis. Where possible, standardized effect estimates were calculated and statistically pooled. Where meta-analysis was not appropriate the data were tabulated and synthesized narratively following a cross-study examination of reported impacts and study characteristics. Qualitative data were summarized using a logic model to map reported impacts and links to health impacts; quantitative data were incorporated into the model. Thirty-nine studies which reported quantitative or qualitative data, or both, were included in the review. Thirty-three quantitative studies were identified. This included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 non-experimental studies of warmth improvements, 12 non-experimental studies of rehousing or retrofitting, three non-experimental studies of provision of basic improvements in low or mIddle Income countries (LMIC), and three non-experimental historical studies of rehousing from slums. Fourteen quantitative studies (42.4%) were assessed to be poor quality and were not included in the synthesis. Twelve studies reporting qualitative data were identified. These were studies of warmth improvements (n = 7) and rehousing (n = 5). Three qualitative studies were excluded from the synthesis due to lack of clarity of methods. Six of the included qualitative studies also reported quantitative data which was included in the review.Very little quantitative synthesis was possible as the data were not amenable to meta-analysis. This was largely due to extreme heterogeneity both methodologically as well as because of variations in the intervention, samples, context, and outcome; these variations remained even following grouping of interventions and outcomes. In addition, few studies reported data that were amenable to calculation of standardized effect sizes. The data were synthesised narratively.Data from studies of warmth and energy efficiency interventions suggested that improvements in general health, respiratory health, and mental health are possible. Studies which targeted those with inadequate warmth and existing chronic respiratory disease were most likely to report health improvement. Impacts following housing-led neighbourhood renewal were less clear; these interventions targeted areas rather than individual households in most need. Two poorer quality LMIC studies reported unclear or small health improvements. One better quality study of rehousing from slums (pre-1960) reported some improvement in mental health. There were few reports of adverse health impacts following housing improvement. A small number of studies gathered data on social and socio-economic impacts associated with housing improvement. Warmth improvements were associated with increased usable space, increased privacy, and improved social relationships; absences from work or school due to illness were also reduced.Very few studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues, and what data were reported were not amenable to synthesis. Housing investment which improves thermal comfort in the home can lead to health improvements, especially where the improvements are targeted at those with inadequate warmth and those with chronic respiratory disease. The health impacts of programmes which deliver improvements across areas and do not target according to levels of individual need were less clear, but reported impacts at an area level may conceal health improvements for those with the greatest potential to benefit. Best available evidence indicates that housing which is an appropriate size for the householders and is affordable to heat is linked to improved health and may promote improved social relationships within and beyond the household. In addition, there is some suggestion that provision of adequate, affordable warmth may reduce absences from school or work.While many of the interventions were targeted at low income groups, a near absence of reporting differential impacts prevented analysis of the potential for housing improvement to impact on social and economic inequalities.",NA,Health,Health,Urban and rural development,Services and housing for the poor,NA,NA,Health,"Health, General",Health policy and administrative management,Other social infrastructure and services,Other Social Infrastructure & Services,Housing policy and administrative management,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Housing Improvement | Rehousing | Warmth And Energy Efficiency,NA,Europe and Central Asia,United Kingdom,High income,No,Liberal democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Description of a range of effect sizes,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,No overall risk of bias information reported.

Health service use was not included as a health outcome as this is not a direct measure of health or well-being. Studies only reporting changes in health service use were excluded from the review. Health service use cannot be considered a direct measure of health status as it is impossible to know whether an increase or decrease in health service use indicates an improvement or deterioration in health. However, where included studies reported health outcomes and health service use, health service use data were extracted and reported (see Appendix 2) but were not included in the final synthesis of health impacts. Details of all the excluded studies and the interventions studied were extracted to provide a comprehensive list of studies which may have been considered eligible, for example by assessing a heath related outcome such as health service use (see list of excluded studies, Table 1). There was no minimum follow-up period to assess health effects. Where a study reported health impacts at multiple time points all impacts were extracted and reported. The final impact was used as the study’s findings.

These systems are based on the assumption that externally promoted adherence to evidence-based standards (through inspection/assessment) will result in higher quality of healthcare. However, the benefits of external inspection in terms of organisational-, provider- and patient-level outcomes are not clear. This is the first update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2011. Objectives To evaluate the eCectiveness of external inspection of compliance with standards in improving healthcare organisation behaviour, healthcare professional behaviour and patient outcomes. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases for studies up to 1 June 2015:the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of ECectiveness, HMIC, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. There was no language restriction and we included studies regardless of publication status. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of relevant papers, accreditation bodies and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), regarding any further published or unpublished work. We also searched an online database of systematic reviews (PDQ-evidence.org). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised trials (NRCTs), interrupted time series (ITSs) and controlled beforeaLer studies (CBAs) evaluating the eCect of external inspection against external standards on healthcare organisation change, healthcare professional behaviour or patient outcomes in hospitals, primary healthcare organisations and other community-based healthcare organisations. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. Since meta-analysis was not possible, we produced a narrative results summary. We used the GRADE tool to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We did notidentify any new eligible studies in this update.One cluster RCT involving 20 South African public hospitals and one ITS involving all acute hospital trusts in England, met the inclusion criteria. A trust is a National Health Service hospital which has opted to withdraw from local authority control and be managed by a trust instead. The cluster RCT reported mixed eCects of external inspection on compliance with COHSASA (Council for Health Services Accreditation for South Africa) accreditation standards andeightindicators of hospitalquality. Improvedtotal compliance scorewithCOHSASA accreditation standards was reported for 21/28 service elements: mean intervention eCect was 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 23% to 37%) (P < 0.001). The score increased from 48% to 78% in intervention hospitals, while remaining the same in control hospitals (43%). The median intervention eCect for the indicators of hospital quality of care was 2.4% (range -1.9% to +11.8%). The ITS study evaluated compliance with policies to address healthcare-acquired infections and reported a mean reduction in MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infection rates of 100 cases per quarter (95% CI -221.0 to 21.5, P = 0.096) at three months' follow-up and an increase of 70 cases per quarter (95% CI -250.5 to 391.0; P = 0.632) at 24 months' follow-up. Regression analysis showed similar MRSA rates before and aLer the external inspection (diCerence in slope 24.27, 95% CI -10.4 to 58.9; P = 0.147). Neither included study reported data on unanticipated/adverse consequences or economic outcomes. The cluster RCT reported mainly outcomes related to healthcare organisation change, and no patient reported outcomes other than patient satisfaction. The certainty of the included evidence from both studies was very low. It is uncertain whether external inspection accreditation programmes lead to improved compliance with accreditation standards. It is also uncertain if external inspection infection programmes lead to improved compliance with standards, and if this in turn influences healthcare-acquired MRSA infection rates. Authors' conclusions The review highlights the paucity of high-quality controlled evaluations of the eCectiveness and the cost-eCectiveness of external inspection systems. If policy makers wish to understand the eCectiveness of this type of intervention better, there needs to be further studies across a range of settings and contexts and studies reporting outcomes important to patients.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Health system strengthening,Human development and gender,Health service delivery,Health,"Health, General",Health policy and administrative management,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Inspection Systems | Compliance | Healthcare  Behaviour,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,South Africa,Upper middle income,No,Electoral democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Not applicable,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,"No overall risk of bias information reported, protocol.

Local opinion leaders (OLs) are individuals perceived as credible and trustworthy, who disseminate and implement best evidence, for instance through informal one-toone teaching or community outreach education visits. The use of OLs is a promising strategy to bridge evidence-practice gaps. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2011. Objectives To assess the e)ectiveness of local opinion leaders to improve healthcare professionals' compliance with evidence-based practice and patient outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers on 3 July 2018, together with searching reference lists of included studies and contacting experts in the field. Selection criteria We considered randomised studies comparing the e)ects of local opinion leaders, either alone or with a single or more intervention(s) to disseminate evidence-based practice, with no intervention, a single intervention, or the same single or more intervention(s). Eligible studies were those reporting objective measures of professional performance, for example, the percentage of patients being prescribed a specific drug or health outcomes, or both. We included all studies independently of the method used to identify OLs. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane procedures in this review. The main comparison was (i) between any intervention involving OLs (OLs alone, OLs with a single or more intervention(s)) versus any comparison intervention (no intervention, a single intervention, or the same single or more intervention(s)). We also made four secondary comparisons: ii) OLs alone versus no intervention, iii) OLs alone versus a single intervention, iv) OLs, with a single or more intervention(s) versus the same single or more intervention(s), and v) OLs with a single or more intervention(s) versus no intervention Main results We included 24 studies, involving more than 337 hospitals, 350 primary care practices, 3005 healthcare professionals, and 29,167 patients (not all studies reported this information). A majority of studies were from North America, and all were conducted in high-income countries. Eighteen of these studies (21 comparisons, 71 compliance outcomes) contributed to the median adjusted risk di)erence (RD) for the main comparison. The median duration of follow-up was 12 months (range 2 to 30 months). The results suggested that the OL interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' compliance with evidence-based practice (10.8% absolute improvement in compliance, interquartile range (IQR): 3.5% to 14.6%; moderate-certainty evidence). Results for the secondary comparisons also suggested that OLs probably improve compliance with evidence-based practice (moderatecertainty evidence): i) OLs alone versus no intervention: RD (IQR): 9.15% (-0.3% to 15%); ii) OLs alone versus a single intervention: RD (range): 13.8% (12% to 15.5%); iii) OLs, with a single or more intervention(s) versus the same single or more intervention(s): RD (IQR): 7.1% (-1.4% to 19%); iv) OLs with a single or more intervention(s) versus no intervention: RD (IQR):10.25% (0.6% to 15.75%). Itis uncertain if OLs alone, orin combination with otherintervention(s), may lead to improved patient outcomes (3 studies; 5 dichotomous outcomes) since the certainty of evidence was very low. For two of the secondary comparisons, the IQR included the possibility of a small negative e)ect of the OL intervention. Possible explanations for the occasional negative e)ects are, for example, the possibility that the OLs may have prioritised some outcomes, atthe expense of others, orthat an unaccounted outcome di)erence at baseline, may have given a faulty impression of a negative e)ect of the intervention at follow-up. No study reported on costs or cost-e)ectiveness. We were unable to determine the comparative e)ectiveness of di)erent approaches to identifying OLs, as most studies used the sociometric method. Nor could we determine which methods used by OLs to educate their peers were most e)ective, as the methods were poorly described in most studies. In addition, we could not determine whether OL teams were more e)ective than single OLs. Authors' conclusions Local opinion leaders alone, or in combination with other interventions, can be e)ective in promoting evidence-based practice, but the e)ectiveness varies both within and between studies.The e)ect on patient outcomes is uncertain. The costs and the cost-e)ectiveness of the intervention(s) is unknown. These results are based on heterogeneous studies di)ering in types of intervention, setting, and outcomes. In most studies, the role and actions of the OL were not clearly described, and we cannot, therefore, comment on strategies to enhance their e)ectiveness. It is also not clear whether the methods used to identify OLs are important for their e)ectiveness, or whether the e)ect di)ers if education is delivered by single OLs or by multidisciplinary OL teams. Further research may help us to understand how these factors a)ect the e)ectiveness of OLs.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Health service delivery,NA,NA,Health,Basic Health,Health personnel development,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Local Opinion Leaders | Patient Outcomes | Medical Staff Performance,NA,North America,Canada,High income,No,Liberal democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,"Sixteen of the included studies were judged to have a 'high' or 'moderate' risk of bias, and two studies to have a 'low' risk of bias.",NA,Government agency,National Institute For Health Research (NIHR),NA,18,2,Not applicable,Local health opinion leaders,"[""Local opinion leaders influence""] -- Opinion leaders dissemination and influence including opinion leaders disseminating their knowledge via informal contact with colleagues as well as formal talks.

The international evidence base for strategies to prevent obesity is very large and is accumulating rapidly. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To determine the eKectiveness of a range of interventions that include diet or physical activity components, or both, designed to prevent obesity in children. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL in June 2015. We re-ran the search from June 2015 to January 2018 and included a search of trial registers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet or physical activity interventions, or combined diet and physical activity interventions, for preventing overweight or obesity in children (0-17 years) that reported outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks from baseline. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk-of-bias and evaluated overall certainty ofthe evidence usingGRADE.We extracted data on adiposity outcomes, sociodemographic characteristics, adverse events, intervention process and costs. We meta-analysed data as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and presented separate meta-analyses by age group for child 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years for zBMI and BMI. Main results We included 153 RCTs, mostly from the USA or Europe. Thirteen studies were based in upper-middle-income countries (UMIC: Brazil, Ecuador, Lebanon, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, US-Mexico border), and one was based in a lower middle-income country (LMIC: Egypt). The majority (85) targeted children aged 6 to 12 years. Children aged 0-5 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 16 RCTs (n = 6261) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (mean diKerence (MD) −0.07 kg/m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.14 to −0.01), and had a similar eKect (11 RCTs, n = 5536) on zBMI (MD −0.11, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.01). Neither diet (moderate-certainty evidence) nor physical activity interventions alone (high-certainty evidence) compared with control reduced BMI (physical activity alone: MD −0.22 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.44 to 0.01) or zBMI (diet alone: MD −0.14, 95% CI −0.32 to 0.04; physical activity alone: MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.10 to 0.13) in children aged 0-5 years. Children aged 6 to 12 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 14 RCTs (n = 16,410) that physical activity interventions, compared with control,reduced BMI (MD −0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.14 to −0.05). However,there is moderate-certainty evidence thatthey had little or no eKect on zBMI (MD −0.02, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.02). There is low-certainty evidence from 20 RCTs (n = 24,043) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control,reduced zBMI (MD −0.05 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.10 to −0.01). There is high-certainty evidence that diet interventions, compared with control, had little impact on zBMI (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.01) or BMI (−0.02 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.06). Children aged 13 to 18 years: There is very low-certainty evidence that physical activity interventions, compared with control reduced BMI (MD −1.53 kg/m2, 95% CI −2.67 to −0.39; 4 RCTs; n = 720); and low-certainty evidence for a reduction in zBMI (MD -0.2, 95% CI −0.3 to -0.1; 1 RCT; n = 100). There is low-certainty evidence from eight RCTs (n = 16,583) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, had no eKect on BMI (MD −0.02 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.10 to 0.05); or zBMI (MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.07; 6 RCTs; n = 16,543). Evidence from two RCTs (low-certainty evidence; n = 294) found no eKect of diet interventions on BMI. Direct comparisons of interventions: Two RCTs reported data directly comparing diet with either physical activity or diet combined with physical activity interventions for children aged 6 to 12 years and reported no diKerences. Heterogeneity was apparent in the results from all three age groups, which could not be entirely explained by setting or duration of the interventions. Where reported, interventions did not appear to result in adverse eKects (16 RCTs) or increase health inequalities (gender: 30 RCTs; socioeconomic status: 18 RCTs), although relatively few studies examined these factors. Re-running the searches in January 2018 identified 315 records with potential relevance to this review, which will be synthesised in the next update. Authors' conclusions Interventions thatincludediet combinedwithphysical activity interventions can reduce the risk of obesity (zBMI andBMI)in young children aged 0 to 5 years. There is weaker evidence from a single study that dietary interventions may be beneficial. However, interventions that focus only on physical activity do not appear to be eKective in children of this age. In contrast, interventions that only focus on physical activity can reduce the risk of obesity (BMI) in children aged 6 to 12 years, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. In these age groups, there is no evidence that interventions that only focus on diet are eKective, and some evidence that diet combined with physical activity interventions may be eKective. Importantly, this updated review also suggests that interventions to prevent childhood obesity do not appear to result in adverse eKects or health inequalities. The review will not be updated in its current form.

Despite an abundance of information, sub-optimal care is common. Many factors influence practitioners' use of health information, and format (electronic or other) may be one such factor. Objectives To assess the eKects of interventions aimed at improving or increasing healthcare practitioners' use of electronic health information (EHI) on professional practice and patient outcomes. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Library (Wiley), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and LISA (EBSCO) up to November 2013. We contacted researchers in the field and scanned reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included studies that evaluated the eKects of interventions to improve or increase the use of EHI by healthcare practitioners on professional practice and patient outcomes. We defined EHI as information accessed on a computer. We defined 'use' as logging into EHI. We considered any healthcare practitioner involved in patient care. We included randomized, non-randomized, and cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs,NRCTs, CRCTs), controlled clinicaltrials (CCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), and controlled before-and-aNer studies (CBAs).The comparisons were: electronic versus printed health information; EHI on diKerent electronic devices (e.g. desktop, laptop or tablet computers, etc.; cell / mobile phones); EHI via diKerent user interfaces; EHI provided with or without an educational or training component; and EHI compared to no other type or source of information. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the included studies. We reassessed previously excluded studies following our decision to define logins to EHI as a measure of professional behavior. We reported results in natural units. When possible, we calculated and reported median eKect size (odds ratio (OR), interquartile ranges (IQR)). Due to high heterogeneity across studies, meta-analysis was not feasible. Main results We included two RCTs and four CRCTs involving 352 physicians, 48 residents, and 135 allied health practitioners. Overall risk of bias was low as was quality of the evidence. One comparison was supported by three studies and three comparisons were supported by single studies, but outcomes across the three studies were highly heterogeneous. We found no studies to support EHI versus no alternative. Given these factors, it was not possible to determine the relative eKectiveness of interventions. All studies reported practitioner use of EHI, two reported on compliance with electronic practice guidelines, and none reported on patient outcomes. One trial (139 participants) measured guideline adherence for an electronic versus printed guideline, but reported no diKerence between groups (median OR 0.85, IQR 0.74 to 1.08). One small cross-over trial (10 participants) reported increased use of clinical guidelines when provided with a mobile versus stationary, desktop computer (mean use per shiN: intervention group (IG) 3.6, standard deviation (SD) 1.7 vs. control group (CG) 2.0 (SD 1.9), P value = 0.033). One cross-over trial (203 participants) reported that using a customized versus a generic interface had little impact on practitioners' use of EHI (mean diKerence in adjusted end-of-study rate: 0.77 logins/month/user, 95% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.43 to 1.11). Three trials included education or training and reported increased use of EHI by practitioners following training. Authors' conclusions This review provided no evidence that the use of EHI translates into improved clinical practice or patient outcomes, though it does suggest that when practitioners are provided with EHI and education or training, the use of EHI increases. We have defined use as the activity of logging into an EHI resource, but based on our findings use does not automatically translate to the application of EHI in practice. While using EHI may be an important component of evidence-based medicine, alone itis insuKicientto improve patient care or clinical practices. For EHI to be applied in patient care, it will be necessary to understand why practitioners' are reluctant to apply EHI when treating people, and to determine the most eKective way(s) to reduce this reluctance.",NA,Health,Health facilities and construction | Public admin - Health | Health,Human development and gender,Health service delivery,NA,NA,Health,"Health, General",Health policy and administrative management,Health,Basic Health,Basic health infrastructure,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Electronic Health Information (EHI) | Healthcare Practitioners | Health,NA,Latin America and Caribbean,Mexico,Upper middle income,No,Electoral democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Other,GRADE,None.,NA,Not specified,Not Specified,NA,6,Not applicable,Not applicable,Health information transfer,"[""Full-service interface""] -- Included a search engine that returned critically appraised articles rated by physicians; included push information, e.g. email alerts on topics of interest to the practitioner. -- full-service interface - p9; We considered any intervention that aimed to improve or increase the use of EHI by practitioners to inform clinical practice.

Such government guidance, referred to as public stewardship, encompasses government policies, regulatory mechanisms, and implementation strategies for ensuring accountability in the delivery of services. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been the subject of a systematic review. Objectives: To assess the effects of public sector regulation, training, or co-ordination of the private for-profit health sector in low- and middle-income countries. Search methods: For related systematic reviews, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) 2015, Issue 4; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) 2015, Issue 1; Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) 2015, Issue 1; all part of The Cochrane Library, and searched 28 April 2015. For primary studies, we searched MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE 1946 to Present, OvidSP (searched 16 June 2016); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index 1987 to present, and Emerging Sources Citation Index 2015 to present, ISI Web of Science (searched 3 May 2016 for papers citing included studies); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2015, Issue 3, part of The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register) (searched 28 April 2015); Embase 1980 to 2015 Week 17, OvidSP (searched 28 April 2015); Global Health 1973 to 2015 Week 16, OvidSP (searched 30 April 2015); WHOLIS, WHO (searched 30 April 2015); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index 1975 to present, ISI Web of Science (searched 30 April 2015); Health Management, ProQuest (searched 22 November 2013). In addition, in April 2016, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and various electronic databases of grey literature. Selection criteria: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, interrupted time series studies, or controlled before-after studies. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data, comparing their results and resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where appropriate, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We did not conduct meta-analysis because of heterogeneity of interventions and study designs. Main results: We identified 20,177 records, 50 of them potentially eligible. We excluded 39 potentially eligible studies because they did not involve a rigorous evaluation of training, regulation, or co-ordination of private for-profit healthcare providers in LMICs; five studies identified after the review was submitted are awaiting assessment; and six studies met our inclusion criteria. Two included studies assessed training alone; one assessed regulation alone; three assessed a multifaceted intervention involving training and regulation; and none assessed co-ordination. All six included studies targeted private for-profit pharmacy workers in Africa and Asia.Three studies found that training probably increases sale of oral rehydration solution (one trial in Kenya, 106 pharmacies: RR 3.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.75; and one trial in Indonesia, 87 pharmacies: RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93) and dispensing of anti-malarial drugs (one trial in Kenya, 293 pharmacies: RR 8.76, 95% CI 0.94 to 81.81); moderate-certainty evidence.One study conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic shows that regulation of the distribution and sale of registered pharmaceutical products may improve composite pharmacy indicators (one trial, 115 pharmacies: improvements in four of six pharmacy indicators; low-certainty evidence).The outcome in three multifaceted intervention studies was the quality of pharmacy practice; including the ability to ask questions, give advice, and provide appropriate treatment. The trials applied regulation, training, and peer influence in sequence; and the study design does not permit separation of the effects of the different interventions. Two trials conducted among 136 pharmacies in Vietnam found that the multifaceted intervention may improve the quality of pharmacy practice; but the third study, involving 146 pharmacies in Vietnam and Thailand, found that the intervention may have little or no effects on the quality of pharmacy practice (low-certainty evidence).Only two studies (both conducted in Vietnam) reported cost data, with no rigorous assessment of the economic implications of implementing the interventions in resource-constrained settings. No study reported data on equity, mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, satisfaction, or attitudes. Authors' conclusions: Training probably improves quality of care (i.e. adherence to recommended practice), regulation may improve quality of care, and we are uncertain about the effects of co-ordination on quality of private for-profit healthcare services in LMICs. The likelihood that further research will find the effect of training to be substantially different from the results of this review is moderate; implying that monitoring of the impact is likely to be needed if training is implemented. The low certainty of the evidence for regulation implies that the likelihood of further research finding the effect of regulation to be substantially different from the results of this review is high. Therefore, an impact evaluation is warranted if government regulation of private for-profit providers is implemented in LMICs. Rigorous evaluations of these interventions should also assess other outcomes such as impacts on equity, cost implications, mortality, morbidity, and adverse effects.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Health system strengthening,Human development and gender,Private sector delivery in health,Health,"Health, General",Health policy and administrative management,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Private For-Profit | Public Stewardship | Public Sector Regulation,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,Kenya,Lower middle income,No,Electoral autocracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,No overall risk of bias information reported.

Scientific literature was searched to identify controlled studies evaluating cell phone voice and text message interventions to address chronic diseases in adults in low- or middle-income countries. Outcomes measured included morbidity, mortality, hospitalization rates, behavioral or lifestyle changes, process of care improvements, clinical outcomes, costs, patient–provider satisfaction, compliance, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: From the 1,709 abstracts retrieved, 163 articles were selected for full text review, including 9 randomized controlled trials with 4,604 participants. Most of the studies addressed more than one outcome. Of the articles selected, six studied clinical outcomes, six studied processes of care, three examined healthcare costs, and two examined HRQoL. M-health positively impacted on chronic disease outcomes, improving attendance rates, clinical outcomes, and HRQoL, and was cost-effective. Conclusions: M-health is emerging as a promising tool to address access, coverage, and equity gaps in developing countries and low-resource settings. The results for m-health interventions showed a positive impact on chronic diseases in LMIC. However, a limiting factor of this review was the relatively small number of studies and patients enrolled, highlighting the need for more rigorous research in this area in developing countries.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Non-communicable diseases,Human development and gender,Health service delivery,Health,Basic Health,Basic health care,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Mhealth | Chronic Disease | Mobile Health | Short Message Service | Cellular Phone,NA,Europe and Central Asia,Poland,High income,No,Liberal democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,No overall provided by authors; assumed the RoB assessment was high if no dimension was rated as high risk of bias.

We grouped interventions into behavioral counseling (1831 participants), dietary modification (1831 participants), physical activity (1014 participants) and multiple interventions (2103 participants). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to evaluate origins of heterogeneity. Lifestyle interventions significantly lowered blood pressure levels in LMIC populations, including in total 6779 participants. The
changes achieved in SBP (95% confidence interval) were: behavioral counseling -5.4 (-10.7, -0.0) mmHg, for dietary modification -3.5 (-5.4, -1.5) mmHg, for physical activity -11.4 (-16.0, -6.7) mmHg and for multiple interventions -6.0 (-8.9, -3.3) mmHg.

Infant massage is increasingly being used in the community with babies and their primary caregivers. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for sleep, respiration and elimination, the reduction of colic and wind, and improved growth. Infant massage is also thought to reduce infant stress and promote positive parent‐infant interaction.

Objectives
The aim of this review was to assess whether infant massage is effective in promoting infant physical and mental health in low‐risk, population samples.

Search methods
Relevant studies were identified by searching the following electronic databases up to June 2011: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Maternity and Infant Care; LILACS; WorldCat (dissertations); ClinicalTrials.gov; China Masters' Theses; China Academic Journals; China Doctoral Dissertations; China Proceedings of Conference. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews.

Selection criteria
We included studies that randomised healthy parent‐infant dyads (where the infant was under the age of six months) to an infant massage group or a 'no‐treatment' control group. Studies had to have used a standardised outcome measure of infant mental or physical development.

Data collection and analysis
Mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. Where appropriate, the results have been combined in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model.

Main results
We included 34 studies, which includes one that was a follow‐up study and 20 that were rated as being at high risk of bias.

We conducted 14 meta‐analyses assessing physical outcomes post‐intervention. Nine meta‐analyses showed significant findings favouring the intervention group for weight (MD ‐965.25 g; 95% CI ‐1360.52 to ‐569.98), length (MD ‐1.30 cm; 95% CI ‐1.60 to ‐1.00), head circumference (MD ‐0.81 cm; 95% CI ‐1.18 to ‐0.45), arm circumference (MD ‐0.47 cm; 95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.13), leg circumference (MD ‐0.31 cm; 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.13), 24‐hour sleep duration (MD ‐0.91 hr; 95% CI ‐1.51 to ‐0.30), time spent crying/fussing (MD ‐0.36; 95% CI ‐0.52 to ‐0.19), deceased levels of blood bilirubin (MD ‐38.11 mmol/L; 95% CI ‐50.61 to ‐25.61), and there were fewer cases of diarrhoea, RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.76). Non‐significant results were obtained for cortisol levels, mean increase in duration of night sleep, mean increase in 24‐hour sleep and for number of cases of upper respiratory tract disease and anaemia.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted for weight, length and head circumference, and only the finding for length remained significant following removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias. These three outcomes were the only ones that could also be meta‐analysed at follow‐up; although both weight and head circumference continued to be significant at 6‐month follow‐up, these findings were obtained from studies conducted in Eastern countries only. No sensitivity analyses were possible.

We conducted 18 meta‐analyses measuring aspects of mental health and development. A significant effect favouring the intervention group was found for gross motor skills (SMD ‐0.44; 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.18), fine motor skills (SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.35), personal and social behaviour (SMD ‐0.90; 95% CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.18) and psychomotor development (SMD ‐0.35; 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.15); although the first three findings were obtained from only two studies, one of which was rated as being at high risk of bias, and the finding for psychomotor development was not maintained following following removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias in a sensitivity analysis. No significant differences were found for a range of aspects of infant temperament, parent‐infant interaction and mental development. Only parent‐infant interaction could be meta‐analysed at follow‐up, and the result was again not significant.

Authors' conclusions
These findings do not currently support the use of infant massage with low‐risk groups of parents and infants. Available evidence is of poor quality, and many studies do not address the biological plausibility of the outcomes being measured, or the mechanisms by which change might be achieved. Future research should focus on the impact of infant massage in higher‐risk groups (for example, demographically and socially deprived parent‐infant dyads), where there may be more potential for change.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Human development and gender,Child health,Health,Basic Health,Basic health care,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Infant | Newborn | Child Development | Massage | Therapeutic Touch | Mental Health | Physical Stimulation,NA,East Asia and Pacific,China,Upper middle income,No,Closed autocracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,"Studies massively weighted (China 20 out of 38) to one country.

Objectives: To summarise and critically appraise evidence for the effectiveness of menstruation management interventions in improving women and girls' education, work and psychosocial wellbeing in low and middle income countries. Methods: Structured systematic searches were conducted in peer-reviewed and grey literature to identify studies evaluating education and resource provision interventions for menstruation management. Individual and cluster randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion, as were non-randomised controlled trials. Study characteristics, outcomes and risk of bias were extracted using a piloted form. Risk of bias was independently assessed by two researchers. Results: Eight studies described in ten citations were eligible for inclusion. Studies were highly heterogeneous in design and context. Six included assessment of education-only interventions, and three provided assessment of the provision of different types of sanitary products (menstrual cups, disposable sanitary pads, and reusable sanitary pads). A moderate but non-significant standardised mean difference was found for the two studies assessing the impact of sanitary pad provision on school attendance: 0.49 (95%CI -0.13, 1.11). Included studies were heterogeneous with considerable risk of bias. Trials of education interventions reported positive impacts on menstrual knowledge and practices, however, many studies failed to assess other relevant outcomes. No trials assessed or reported harms. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of menstruation management interventions, although current results are promising. Eight trials have been conducted, but a high risk of bias was found and clinical heterogeneity precluded synthesis of most results. Whilst trials provided some indication of positive results, further research is needed to establish the role of menstruation hygiene management in education performance, employment and other psychosocial outcomes.

Findings: Ten studies were included (4 pre- and post-studies, 2 randomized controlled trials, 2 cohort studies, 1 cross-sectional study, and 1 case-control study). The role of CHWs consisted of patient education, identification and referral of high-risk individuals to physicians, and provision of social support through home visits. Positive outcomes were reported in 7 of 10 studies. These outcomes included increased knowledge of T2DM symptoms and prevention measures; increased adoption of treatment-seeking and prevention measures; increased medication adherence; and improved fasting blood sugar, glycated hemoglobin, and body mass index.

Concerns about the effectiveness of blended learning have led to an increasing number of studies on this topic. However, there has yet to be a quantitative synthesis evaluating the effectiveness of blended learning on knowledge acquisition in health professions. Objective: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of blended learning for health professional learners compared with no intervention and with nonblended learning. We also aimed to explore factors that could explain differences in learning effects across study designs, participants, country socioeconomic status, intervention durations, randomization, and quality score for each of these questions. Methods: We conducted a search of citations in Medline, CINAHL, Science Direct, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and ERIC through September 2014. Studies in any language that compared blended learning with no intervention or nonblended learning among health professional learners and assessed knowledge acquisition were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated study quality and abstracted information including characteristics of learners and intervention (study design, exercises, interactivity, peer discussion, and outcome assessment). Results: We identified 56 eligible articles. Heterogeneity across studies was large (I(2) ≥93.3) in all analyses.

by securing for themselves a territory and a set of symbols that gives meaning to their membership in the group. This endeavor to exercise their citizenship is, in many cases, a violation of their own and others’ rights, and frequently generates violence and crime in a vicious circle that perpetuates their original exclusion.

Publication dates of included studies ranged between 1992 and 2012, with six studies published in the four-year period 2010-2013. A key finding of this review is the overall scarcity of robust evidence, as indicated by the relatively few studies that met the inclusion criteria. Although the evidence in general showed positive results, we need to be wary of drawing strong inferences from the findings of this body of literature. Not only is the number of impact evaluations limited, but most used designs in which conclusively attributing causality is not possible.Our assessment of the evidence does not allow us to develop practical suggestions on what interventions are likely to work, for whom, and when. Clearly, there is an urgent need for investment in high quality impact evaluations of interventions to support people with disabilities in accessing the labour market in low- and middle income settings. To build the evidence base further, it is therefore important that many more of the interventions currently in existence in low- and middle-income countries are rigorously evaluated, and the results are reported and disseminated widely.

A coding tool was developed to capture study design characteristics, participant
characteristics, intervention characteristics, outcome characteristics, data for effect
size calculation (and/or other outcome data) and other substantive and descriptive
study features.
Each study was appraised to determine its internal validity—that is, make sure that
the study has been designed and conducted in such a way as to minimise the risk of
bias, and that the outcomes are likely to be attributable to the intervention being
assessed, rather than some other factor.
Included studies were coded on the following domains:
 Potential for selection bias/confounding due to non-random assignment, no
adjustment for differences in baseline measurements, etc.
 Potential bias due to attrition, compliance or otherwise missing data.
 Potential for performance bias due to systematic differences in the care provided
to participants (e.g., spill-over, non-intervention based differences in treatment,
or other types of interference across intervention and non-intervention units).  Potential bias due to systematic differences in outcomes assessment among
groups being compared (detection bias).
 Selective outcome and analysis reporting based on systematic differences
between reported and unreported findings.
For each of these domains, we coded the paper as ‘Yes’ if it addressed the issue, ‘No’
if it did not, ‘Unclear’ if it was unclear, and ‘Not relevant’ if the issue was not
applicable for that particular study. For those domains with two parts (‘a’ and ‘b’),
both parts had to be answered ‘Yes’ for the study to score ‘Yes’ overall for that
domain. We then aggregated to an overall risk of bias as follows:
 Low Risk of Bias (bias, if present, is unlikely to alter the results of the research):
Yes’ for four or five categories.

However, little is known about the impact of mental health treatments on IPV victimization or perpetration, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).MethodsWe conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined ‘mental health treatment’ as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated.ResultsWe identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions.ConclusionsToo few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Gender,Human development and gender,Non-communicable diseases,Government and civil society,Government & Civil Society - General,Ending violence against women and girls,Health,Non_communicable diseases (NCDs),Promotion of mental health and well-being,Gender Equality | Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population,Sex | Ethnicity | Other,"VULNERABLE POP'L: We included prospective, controlled studies (either via comparison group or statistical design that enabled “self control” comparisons) that assessed the impact of mental health treatments on IPV among a sample primarily composed of adolescents and adults (at least 50% of the sample was age 10 or older) in LMIC.

Outcomes. Table 2.2 shows that the studies measured several different
ECD and maltreatment outcomes. ECD constructs included: child behavior
problems and difficulties (n = 4), emotional problems (n = 2), prosocial
behavior (n = 2), conduct problems (n = 2), hyperactivity (n = 1), peer relationships
(n = 1), physical health (n = 1), psychomotor skills (n = 1),
cognitive development (n = 1), and academic achievement (n = 1). Four
studies relied exclusively on parent reporting of ECD measures. Only two
studies included direct observation of any ECD measure, including assessment
of children’s cognition in the Turkish Early Enrichment Program and
use of a medical team and nurses to measure all ECD measures in the Chile
home visit program. Maltreatment outcomes included: discipline (n = 2),
attitudes (n = 2), teacher negative behavior (n = 1), child abuse (n = 1),
and child-rearing practices (including harsh treatment) (n=1). Three studies
relied on caregiver self-reported child maltreatment outcomes, whereas
the remaining three studies used independent observation of physical discipline
and child abuse over time.
Instruments: At least nine different
instruments were used to measure ECD outcomes, including the Behavior
Screening Questionnaire (n = 1), Children’s Embedded Figures Test
(n = 1), Dyadic Parent–Child Interaction Schedule and the Teacher-Pupil
Observation Tool (n = 1), Goodenough’s Draw-A-Person test (n = 1), Parent

Studies published from January 2000 to January 2017 will be reviewed with no language limits. Any experimental, quasi-experimental, or controlled trials will be included.

The aim of this paper was to generate an interactive evidence and gap map (EGM) of the total review evidence on interventions engaging men/boys across the full range of WHO SRHR outcomes and report a systematic review of the quantity, quality and effect of gender-transformative interventions with men/boys to improve SRHR for all.MethodsFor this EGM and systematic review, academic and non-academic databases (CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index-expanded, Cochrane Library, Campbell Collaboration, Embase, Global Health Library and Scopus) were searched using terms related to SRHR, males/masculinities, systematic reviews and trials (January 2007–July 2018) with no language restrictions for review articles of SRHR interventions engaging men/boys. Data were extracted from included reviews, and AMSTAR2 was used to assess quality. Outcomes were based on WHO reproductive health strategy.ResultsFrom the 3658 non-duplicate records screened, the total systematic reviews of interventions engaging men/boys in SRHR was mapped through an EGM (n=462 reviews) showing that such interventions were relatively evenly spread across low-income (24.5%), middle-income (37.8%) and high-income countries (37.8%). The proportion of reviews that included gender-transformative interventions engaging men/boys was low (8.4%, 39/462), the majority was in relation to violence against women/girls (n=18/39, 46.2%) and conducted in lower and middle-income countries (n=25/39, 64%). Reviews of gender-transformative interventions were generally low/critically low quality (n=34/39, 97.1%), and findings inconclusive (n=23/39, 59%), but 38.5% (n=15/39) found positive results.ConclusionResearch and programming must be strengthened in engagement of men/boys; it should be intentional in promoting a gender-transformative approach, explicit in the intervention logic models, with more robust experimental designs and measures, and supported with qualitative evaluations.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Gender,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Government and civil society,Government & Civil Society - General,Ending violence against women and girls,Population policies/programmes and reproductive health,Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,Reproductive health care,Gender Equality | Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population | Equity sensitive analytical framework,Sex,"Vulnerable population/ equity sensitive methodology: The WHO defines a gender-transformative approach as one ‘that address the causes of gender-based health inequities through approaches that challenge and redress harmful and unequal gender norms, roles, and power relations that privilege men over women’.11 Men are also implicated in the harmful consequences of gender inequality, harming their own and other men’s health and the health of their female partners as a result of narrow and constraining definitions of what it means to be a man, therefore gender-transformative approaches also benefit men in broadening the interpretation of masculinity and the socially acceptable ways in which masculinity can be expressed.",Public Health | Systematic review | Reproductive Health | Gender Equality | Masculinities,NA,Multi-continent,Multi-country,NA,No,NA,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Not applicable,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Other,AMSTAR2,"Double-blind data extraction was conducted by two authors (ER-M and KCvW).

The movement towards working with boys and men over the past couple of decades has increased the number of interventions specifically directed at men who perpetrate violence against a female partner. There is little evidence-based research on key characteristics of effective interventions directed at men to reduce or prevent IPV against female partners. The objective of this systematic review is to identify interventions specifically directed at&nbsp;males , as the perpetrators of violence against women, that have proven to be effective in preventing or reducing intimate partner violence.MethodsThe following electronic databases will be used to search for peer-reviewed studies: MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycInfo (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (EBSCO), Gender Watch (ProQuest), Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), PROSPERO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Database (Ovid) and SCOPUS. We will include randomized control trials, non-randomized studies of interventions published in peer-reviewed journals and relevant unpublished manuscripts, books/chapters and clinical or programme study reports. Studies have to demonstrate direction of effect (i.e. pre-post intervention/difference between groups) in terms of prevention or reduction in the outlined outcomes. Primary outcomes include change in behaviour and knowledge of male perpetrator regarding the impact of IPV on women as well as women’s experience of IPV. Secondary outcomes include change in behaviours around substance use and social activities, decrease in negative mental health outcomes and interactions with law enforcement. Studies will be screened, appraised and extracted by two reviewers; any conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Narrative synthesis will be used to analyse and present findings. If sufficient and comparable data is available, a meta-analysis will be conducted.DiscussionThis review will provide synthesized evidence on interventions directed at&nbsp;males to reduce or prevent their perpetration of intimate partner violence against female partners. Implications for practice will include key characteristics of interventions proven to be effective based on evidence synthesis and certainty of findings.

We examined the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for IPV among women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).MethodsSeven databases were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining psychosocial interventions for IPV in LMICs. Thirteen RCTs were included in random-effects meta-analyses. Risk ratios (RR) and risk difference were calculated as pooled effect sizes. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Cochrane tool accounting for cluster RCTs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk of bias and design characteristics. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed.ResultsPsychosocial interventions reduced any form of IPV by 27% at shortest (relative risk (RR) = 0.73) and 25% at longest (RR = 0.75) follow up. Physical IPV was reduced by 22% at shortest (RR = 0.78) and 27% at longest (RR = 0.73) follow up. Sexual IPV was reduced by 23% at longest follow up (RR = 0.77) but showed no significant effect at shortest follow-up. Sensitivity analyses for risk of bias led to an increase in magnitude of the effect for any form of IPV and physical IPV. The effect on sexual IPV was no longer significant. Heterogeneity was moderate to high in the majority of comparisons.ConclusionsPsychosocial interventions may reduce the impact of IPV in humanitarian or low and middle income settings.

Aim: To examine the quantity and quality of evidence on WASH interventions on health outcomes in humanitarian crises, as well as evaluate current evidence on their effectiveness against health outcomes in these contexts. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted of primary and grey quantitative literature on WASH interventions measured against health outcomes in humanitarian crises occurring from 1980–2014. Populations of interest were those in resident in humanitarian settings, with a focus on acute crisis and early recovery stages of humanitarian crises in low and middle-income countries. Interventions of interest were WASH-related, while outcomes of interest were health-related. Study quality was assessed via STROBE/CONSORT criteria. Results were analyzed descriptively, and PRISMA reporting was followed. Results: Of 3963 studies initially retrieved, only 6 published studies measured a statistically significant change in health outcome as a result of a WASH intervention. All 6 studies employed point-of-use (POU) water quality interventions, with 50% using safe water storage (SWS) and 35% using household water treatment (HWT). All 6 studies used self-reported diarrhea outcomes, 2 studies also reported laboratory confirmed outcomes, and 2 studies reported health treatment outcomes (e.g. clinical admissions). 1 study measured WASH intervention success in relation to both health and water quality outcomes; 1 study recorded uptake (use of soap) as well as health outcomes. 2 studies were unblinded randomized-controlled trials, while 4 were uncontrolled longitudinal studies. 2 studies were graded as providing high quality evidence; 3 studies provided moderate and 1 study low quality evidence. Conclusion: The current evidence base on the impact of WASH interventions on health outcomes in humanitarian crises is extremely limited, and numerous methodological limitations limit the ability to determine associative, let alone causal, relationships.

Drinking water contaminated by chemicals or pathogens is a major public health threat in the developing world. Responses to this threat often require water consumers (households or communities) to improve their own management or treatment of water. One approach hypothesized to increase such positive behaviors is increasing knowledge of the risks of unsafe water through the dissemination of water contamination data. This paper reviews the evidence for this approach in changing behavior and subsequent health outcomes. Methods/Principal Findings. A systematic review was conducted for studies where results of tests for contaminants in drinking water were disseminated to populations whose water supply posed a known health risk. Studies of any design were included where data were available from a contemporaneous comparison or control group. Using multiple sources >14,000 documents were located. Six studies met inclusion criteria (four of arsenic contamination and two of microbiological contamination). Meta-analysis was not possible in most cases due to heterogeneity of outcomes and study designs. Outcomes included water quality, change of water source, treatment of water, knowledge of contamination, and urinary arsenic. Source switching was most frequently reported: of 5 reporting studies 4 report significantly higher rates of switching (26–72%) among those who received a positive test result and a pooled risk difference was calculate for 2 studies (RD = 0.43 [CI0.4.0–0.46] 6–12 months post intervention) suggesting 43% more of those with unsafe wells switched source compared to those with safe wells. Strength of evidence is low since the comparison is between non-equivalent groups. Two studies concerning fecal contamination reported non-significant increases in point-of-use water treatment .Conclusion: Despite the publication of some large cohort studies and some encouraging results the evidence base to support dissemination of contamination data to improve water management is currently equivocal.

Men in developing countries are the chief decision-makers, determining women's access to maternal health services and influencing their health outcomes. At present, it is unclear whether involving men in maternal health can improve maternal outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of male involvement on maternal health outcomes of women in developing countries.Methods Four electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched (up to May 2013), together with reference lists of included studies. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the quality of studies based on prespecified criteria. Measures of effects were pooled and random effect meta-analysis was conducted, where possible.Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Male involvement was significantly associated with reduced odds of postpartum depression (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.68 for male involvement during pregnancy; OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62 for male involvement post partum), and also with improved utilisation of maternal health services (skilled birth attendance and postnatal care). Male involvement during pregnancy and at post partum appeared to have greater benefits than male involvement during delivery.Conclusions Male involvement is associated with improved maternal health outcomes in developing countries.

An estimated 2.4 billion people still lack access to improved sanitation and 946 million still practice open defecation. The World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned this review to assess the impact of sanitation on coverage and use, as part of its effort to develop a set of guidelines on sanitation and health. Methods. and findings We systematically reviewed the literature and used meta-analysis to quantitatively characterize how different sanitation interventions impact latrine coverage and use. We also assessed both qualitative and quantitative studies to understand how different structural and design characteristics of sanitation are associated with individual latrine use. A total of 64 studies met our eligibility criteria. Of 27 intervention studies that reported on household latrine coverage and provided a point estimate with confidence interval, the average increase in coverage was 14% (95% CI: 10%, 19%). The intervention types with the largest absolute increases in coverage included the Indian government's “Total Sanitation Campaign” (27%; 95% CI: 14%, 39%), latrine subsidy/provision interventions (16%; 95% CI: 8%, 24%), latrine subsidy/provision interventions that also incorporated education components (17%; 95% CI: −5%, 38%), sewerage interventions (14%; 95% CI: 1%, 28%), sanitation education interventions (14%; 95% CI: 3%, 26%), and community-led total sanitation interventions (12%; 95% CI: −2%, 27%). Of 10 intervention studies that reported on household latrine use, the average increase was 13% (95% CI: 4%, 21%). The sanitation interventions and contexts in which they were implemented varied, leading to high heterogeneity across studies. We found 24 studies that examined the association between structural and design characteristics of sanitation facilities and facility use. These studies reported that better maintenance, accessibility, privacy, facility type, cleanliness, newer latrines, and better hygiene access were all frequently associated with higher use, whereas poorer sanitation conditions were associated with lower use. Conclusions Our results indicate that most sanitation interventions only had a modest impact on increasing latrine coverage and use. A further understanding of how different sanitation characteristics and sanitation interventions impact coverage and use is essential in order to more effectively attain sanitation access for all, eliminate open defecation, and ultimately improve health.",NA,"Water, sanitation, and waste management",Sanitation,Urban and rural development,Urban water and sanitation,Urban and rural development,Rural water and sanitation,Water and sanitation,Water Supply & Sanitation,Basic sanitation,Water and sanitation,Water Supply & Sanitation,Education and training in water supply and sanitation,Clean Water and Sanitation,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,No discussion of gender or vulnerable populations.,Latrine Use | Latrine Coverage | Sanitation | Sanitation Uptake,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,Benin,Low income,No,Electoral democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Liverpool Quality Assessment Tool (LQAT),NA,LQAT risk of bias tool.,NA,International aid agency,World Health Organization (WHO),NA,64,Not reported,Not reported,Accessible latrines and toilets | Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) | Educational sanitation promotion | Social marketing | Household latrine and toilet provision | Construction of rural drainage | Construction of urban drainage,"Overall (any sanitation intervention, community-led total sanitation, latrine subsidy-procision, sanitation education, sanitation marketing, sewerage) p.17",Index of access to sanitation,Change in latrine coverage - Figure 2.

Continuum of care has the potential to improve maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) by ensuring care for mothers and children. Continuum of care in MNCH is widely accepted as comprising sequential time (from pre-pregnancy to motherhood and childhood) and space dimensions (from community-family care to clinical care). However, it is unclear which linkages of care could have a greater effect on MNCH outcomes. The objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of different continuum of care linkages for reducing neonatal, perinatal, and maternal mortality in low- and middle-income countries.MethodsWe searched for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that addressed two or more linkages of continuum of care and attempted to increase mothers’ uptake of antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care. The outcome variables were neonatal, perinatal, and maternal mortality.ResultsOut of the 7,142 retrieved articles, we selected 19 as eligible for the final analysis. Of these studies, 13 used packages of intervention that linked antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care. One study each used packages that linked antenatal care and skilled birth attendance or skilled birth attendance and postnatal care. Four studies used an intervention package that linked antenatal care and postnatal care. Among the packages that linked antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care, a significant reduction was observed in combined neonatal, perinatal, and maternal mortality risks (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.89, I2 79%). Furthermore, this linkage reduced combined neonatal, perinatal, and maternal mortality when integrating the continuum of care space dimension (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93, I2 81%).ConclusionsOur review suggests that continuous uptake of antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care is necessary to improve MNCH outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. The review was conclusive for the reduction of neonatal and perinatal deaths. Although maternal deaths were not significantly reduced, composite measures of all mortality were. Thus, the evidence is sufficient to scale up this intervention package for the improvement of MNCH outcomes.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Human development and gender,Health system strengthening,Population policies/programmes and reproductive health,Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,Reproductive health care,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Is looking at maternal health but does not actually have an equity focus.,Continuum Of Care | Maternal Mortality,NA,East Asia and Pacific,Vietnam,Lower middle income,No,Electoral autocracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,None,NA,International aid agency,Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),NA,19,Not reported,Not reported,Antenatal care | Labour and delivery support | Postnatal care,"Interventions and Controls. Interventions comprised packaged care/services that addressed different continuum of care time and space stages. According to the WHO and the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, the time dimension of continuum of care starts from pre-pregnancy and progresses to childhood and motherhood. However, given that we focused on neonatal, perinatal, and maternal mortality in the review, the target periods were only the pregnancy, birth, and postnatal periods of mothers and neonates. The space dimension of continuum of care comprises three care stages—community–family care, outpatient–outreach care, and clinic care [3]. The community–family care interventions included home or community-based care practices addressing mothers and neonates’ healthy behaviors. The outpatient–outreach care included population-oriented services that health facilities or mobile services delivered routinely or periodically according to defined schedules. The clinical care interventions included individual-oriented care through facility-based care at primary and referral levels. (p.4)",Neonatal mortality,"Neonatal mortality - Fig 3.

Methods 16 online international databases were searched to identify studies evaluating the impact of mHealth interventions on MNCH outcomes in LMIC, between January 1990 and May 2014. Comparable studies were included in a random–effects meta–analysis. Findings Of 8593 unique references screened after de–duplication, 15 research articles and two conference abstracts met inclusion criteria, including 12 intervention and three observational studies. Only two studies were graded at low risk of bias. Only one study demonstrated an improvement in morbidity or mortality, specifically decreased risk of perinatal death in children of mothers who received SMS support during pregnancy, compared with routine prenatal care. Meta–analysis of three studies on infant feeding showed that prenatal interventions using SMS/cell phone (vs routine care) improved rates of breastfeeding (BF) within one hour after birth (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27–2.75, I2 = 80.9%) and exclusive BF for three/four months (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26–2.50, I2 = 52.8%) and for six months (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.46–3.68, I2 = 0.0%).

Our primary aim was to evaluate the impact of BPCR interventions involving women, families and communities during the prenatal, postnatal and neonatal periods to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in developing countries. We also examined intervention impact on a variety of intermediate outcomes important for maternal and child survival. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of BPCR interventions in populations of pregnant women living in developing countries. To identify relevant studies, we searched the scientific literature in the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Reproductive health library, CINAHL and Popline databases. We also undertook manual searches of article bibliographies and web sites. Study inclusion was based on pre-specified criteria. We synthesised data by computing pooled relative risks (RR) using the Cochrane RevMan software. Results: Fourteen randomized studies (292 256 live births) met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed that exposure to BPCR interventions was associated with a statistically significant reduction of 18% in neonatal mortality risk (twelve studies, RR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.91) and a non-significant reduction of 28% in maternal mortality risk (seven studies, RR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.13). Results were highly heterogeneous (I2 = 76%, p &lt; 0.001 and I2 = 72%, p = 0.002 for neonatal and maternal results, respectively). Subgroup analyses of studies in which at least 30% of targeted women participated in interventions showed a 24% significant reduction of neonatal mortality risk (nine studies, RR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.85) and a 53% significant reduction in maternal mortality risk (four studies, RR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.87). Pooled results revealed that BPCR interventions were also associated with increased likelihood of use of care in the event of newborn illness, clean cutting of the umbilical cord and initiation of breastfeeding in the first hour of life.

For the outcome of improved care seeking from a health facility, after pooling the data from six RCTs with 4760 subjects in the intervention and 4398 subjects in the control arm, there was a significant improvement in care seeking in the home visit arm (RR=1.35; 95% CI=1.15 to 1.58). Moderate quality evidence indicated that home visits by trained CHWs were associated with improved care-seeking for sick young infants from health facilities by appropriate health care providers in resource-limited settings. However, there is a lack of data regarding successful identification of serious illness. Evidence from validation studies supports the implementation of home visits by trained CHWs for improving outcomes in sick newborns and young infants in resource-limited areas.

This systematic review aims to collect evidence about the differential effects of interventions on different sociodemographic groups in order to identify interventions that were effective in reducing maternal or child health inequalities. Methods We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and other relevant databases. The reference lists of included reviews were also screened to find more eligible studies. We included experimental or observational studies that assessed the effects of interventions on maternal and child health, but only studies that report quantitative inequality outcomes were finally included for analysis. Results 22 articles about the effectiveness of interventions on equity in maternal and child health were finally included. These studies covered five kinds of interventions: immunization campaigns, nutrition supplement programs, health care provision improvement interventions, demand side interventions, and mixed interventions. The outcome indicators covered all MDG 4 and three MDG 5 outcomes. None of the included studies looked at equity in maternal mortality, adolescent birth rate and unmet need for family planning. The included studies reported inequalities based on gender, income, education level or comprehensive socioeconomic status. Stronger or moderate evidence showed that all kinds of the included interventions may be more effective in improving maternal or child health for those from disadvantaged groups. Conclusion Studies about the effectiveness of interventions on equity in maternal or child health are limited.

However, there is limited evidence to support this hypothesis. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions to train and deploy lay refugees and/or IDPs for the provision of basic health service to other women, children, and families in camps. Methods: PubMed, Science and Social Science Citation Indices, PsycINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched (from inception to June 30, 2014) with the aim of identifying studies that reported the effects of interventions that trained and deployed lay refugees and/or IDPs for the provision of basic health service to other women, children, and families in camps. Two investigators independently reviewed all titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant articles. Discrepancies were resolved by repeated review, discussion, and consensus. Study quality assessment was undertaken using standard protocols. Results: Ten studies (five cross-sectional, four pre-post, and one post-test only) conducted in Africa (Guinea and Tanzania), Central America (Belize), and Asia (Myanmar) were included. The studies demonstrated some positive impact on population health associated with training and deployment of trained lay refugees/ IDPs as health workers in camps. Reported effects included increased service coverage, increased knowledge about disease symptoms and prevention, increased adoption of improved treatment seeking and protective behaviors, increased uptake of services, and improved access to reproductive health information. One study, which assessed the effect of peer refugee health education on sexual and reproductive health, did not demonstrate a marked reduction in unintended pregnancies among refugee/IDP women. Conclusion: Although available evidence suggests a positive impact of training and deployment of lay refugees/IDPs as health workers in camps, existing body of evidence is weak, and calls for a re-examination of current
practices. Interventions that promote training and deployment of lay refugees/IDPs as health workers in camps should include strong evaluation components in order to facilitate assessment of effects on population health.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Human development and gender,Skills development,Health,Basic Health,Basic health care,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Humanitarian aid,Sub-group analysis (other than sex),Sex | Displaced populations,Refugees.

The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity and to improve quality of care by improving the delivery of a variety of curative and preventive medical and behavioral interventions at health facilities, at home, and in the community. Objectives: To evaluate the eHects of programs that implement the IMCI strategy in terms of death, nutritional status, quality of care, coverage with IMCI deliverables, and satisfaction of beneficiaries. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), including the Cochrane EHective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE, Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EbscoHost; the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Virtual Health Library (VHL); the WHO Library &amp; Information Networks for Knowledge Database (WHOLIS); the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science; Population Information Online (POPLINE); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); and the Global Health, Ovid and Health Management, ProQuest database. We performed searches until 30 June 2015 and supplemented these by searching revised bibliographies and by contacting experts to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-aMer (CBA) studies with at least two intervention and two control sites evaluating the generic IMCI strategy or its adaptation in children younger than age five, and including at minimum eHorts to improve health care worker skills for case management. We excluded studies in which IMCI was accompanied by other interventions including conditional cash transfers, food supplementation, and employment. The comparison group received usual health services without provision of IMCI. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened searches, selected trials, and extracted, analysed and tabulated data. We used inverse variance for cluster trials and an intracluster co-eHicient of 0.01 when adjustment had not been made in the primary study. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results: Two cluster-randomised trials (India and Bangladesh) and two controlled before-after studies (Tanzania and India) met our inclusion criteria. Strategies included training of health care staff, management strengthening of health care systems (all four studies), and home visiting (two studies). The two studies from India included care packages targeting the neonatal period. One trial in Bangladesh estimated that child mortality may be 13% lower with IMCI, but the confidence interval (CI) included no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.10; 5090 participants; low-certainty evidence). One CBA study in Tanzania gave almost identical estimates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.05; 1932 participants). One trial in India examined infant and neonatal mortality by implementing the integrated management of neonatal and childhood illness (IMNCI) strategy including post-natal home visits. Neonatal and infant mortality may be lower in the IMNCI group compared with the control group (infant mortality hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94; neonatal mortality HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03; one trial, 60,480 participants; low-certainty evidence). We estimated the eHect of IMCI on any mortality measured by combining infant and child mortality in the one IMCI and the one IMNCI trial. Mortality may be reduced by IMCI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93; two trials, 65,570 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials (India, Bangladesh) evaluated nutritional status and noted that there may be little or no eHect on stunting (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06; 5242 participants, two trials; low-certainty evidence) and there is probably little or no eHect on wasting (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; two trials, 4288 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The Tanzania CBA study showed similar results. Investigators measured quality of care by observing prescribing for common illnesses at health facilities (727 observations, two studies; very low-certainty evidence) and by observing prescribing by lay health care workers (1051 observations, three studies; very low-certainty evidence). We could not confirm a consistent eHect on prescribing at health facilities or by lay health care workers, as certainty of the evidence was very low. For coverage of IMCI deliverables, we examined vaccine and vitamin A coverage, appropriate care seeking, and exclusive breast feeding. Two trials (India, Bangladesh) estimated vaccine coverage for measles and reported that there is probably little or no effect on measles vaccine coverage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; two trials, 4895 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with similar effects seen in the Tanzania CBA study. Two studies measured the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine; and two measured vitamin A coverage, all providing little or no evidence of increased coverage with IMCI. Four studies (2 from India, and 1 each from Tanzania and Bangladesh) reported appropriate care seeking and derived information from careful questioning of mothers about recent illness. Some studies on eHects of IMCI may report better care seeking behavior, but others do not report this. All four studies recorded maternal responses on exclusive breast feeding. They provided mixed results and very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we do not know whether IMCI impacts exclusive breast feeding. No studies reported on the satisfaction of mothers and service users. Authors' conclusions: The mix of interventions examined in research studies evaluating the IMCI strategy varies, and some studies include specific inputs to improve neonatal health. Most studies were conducted in South Asia. Implementing the integrated management of childhood illness strategy may reduce child mortality, and packages that include interventions for the neonatal period may reduce infant mortality. IMCI may have little or no eHect on nutritional status and probably has little or no eHect on vaccine coverage. Maternal care seeking behavior may be more appropriate with IMCI, but study results have been mixed, providing evidence of very low certainty about whether IMCI has effects on adherence to exclusive breast feeding.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Child health,Human development and gender,Nutrition,Health,Basic Health,Health personnel development,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Disease Management | Infant Mortality | Quality Improvement | Breastfeeding | Child Health Services | Child Mortality | Controlled Before-After Studies | Delivery Of Health Care | Health Personnel | House Calls | Program Evaluation | Randomized Controlled Trials,NA,South Asia,India,Lower middle income,No,Electoral democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,See page 17.

Coverage with the World Health Organization–recommended prevention strategy for pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is low. We conducted a systematic review to explore factors affecting delivery, access, and use of IPTp and ITNs among healthcare providers and women. Methods and Results We searched the Malaria in Pregnancy Library and Global Health Database from 1 January 1990 to 23 April 2013, without language restriction. Data extraction was performed by two investigators independently, and data was appraised for quality and content. Data on barriers and facilitators, and the effect of interventions, were explored using content analysis and narrative synthesis. We conducted a meta-analysis of determinants of IPTp and ITN uptake using random effects models, and performed subgroup analysis to evaluate consistency across interventions and study populations, countries, and enrolment sites. We did not perform a meta-ethnography of qualitative data. Ninety-eight articles were included, of which 20 were intervention studies. Key barriers to the provision of IPTp and ITNs were unclear policy and guidance on IPTp; general healthcare system issues, such as stockouts and user fees; health facility issues stemming from poor organisation, leading to poor quality of care; poor healthcare provider performance, including confusion over the timing of each IPTp dose; and women's poor antenatal attendance, affecting IPTp uptake. Key determinants of IPTp coverage were education, knowledge about malaria/IPTp, socio-economic status, parity, and number and timing of antenatal clinic visits. Key determinants of ITN coverage were employment status, education, knowledge about malaria/ITNs, age, and marital status. Predictors showed regional variations. Conclusions Delivery of ITNs through antenatal clinics presents fewer problems than delivery of IPTp. Many obstacles to IPTp delivery are relatively simple barriers that could be resolved in the short term. Other barriers are more entrenched within the overall healthcare system or socio-economic/cultural contexts, and will require medium- to long-term strategies.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Malaria control,Human development and gender,Reproductive and maternal health,Health,Basic Health,Infectious disease control,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population,Other,This review looks at interventions to prevent malaria targeted at pregnant women.,Bednets | Pregnant | Malaria | Preventative Treatment,NA,Sub-Saharan Africa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Content analysis,NA,Other,Not applicable,"Meta-analyses were conducted on the determinants and barriers of ITNs and ITPs take up.

One category of human health impacts (designated in this review as non-food health impacts) focuses on indirect effects of GM crop cultivation; amongst which the most prominent are health benefits via: (1) reduced use of pesticides, and (2) an increase in income. Both of these pathways have raised a lot of interest in the developing world, especially in areas experiencing high rates of pesticide poisonings and low agricultural incomes. However, evidence to support such benefits has been relatively scarce in comparison to that of GM food health impacts. Non-food health impacts of GM crop cultivation on farmers deserve more attention, not just because of an apparent knowledge gap, but also because of, potential economic and environmental implications, involving for example CO2 emissions, underground water contamination and improved sanitation. Methods/Design: The primary research question was: What are the non-food impacts of GM crop cultivation on farmers’ health? To address this primary question, the study focused on two related secondary questions: (1) Does the cultivation of GM crops result in a lower number of pesticide-related poisonings as compared to the cultivation of their non-GM counterparts?, and; (2) Does the cultivation of GM crops allow for higher financial resources to be used by farmers to improve the health status of themselves and their family, as compared to the cultivation of the non-GM counterpart? The extent to which information relevant to the two secondary questions was freely-available was also evaluated. The search and assessment methodologies were adapted following experience gained during a scoping exercise, and followed the published protocol. Results: The 20 databases and 10 reviews searched returned 4,870 hits, with 19 identified as relevant for data extraction. It was apparent that the 19 articles were derived from only 9 original studies, of which 7 were relevant to the first research question, whilst the remaining 2 were relevant to the second question. The studies showed both an overall decrease in the amount of pesticides applied and an increase in household income from GM crop cultivation as compared to the cultivation of the non-GM counterpart. Conclusion: In the absence of additional confounding variables or statistical analyses to support these findings, any correlation from these studies should be considered circumstantial at best. Even though the cultivation of GM crops appears to increase household income, evidence to demonstrate that farmers invested this extra income in improving their health remained inconclusive. Further research is therefore needed to clarify the possible correlation between GM crop cultivation and (1) pesticide poisonings, and (2) overall health improvements. Future impact evaluations should include: both written records and surveys; statistical correlations between independent and dependent variables; testing the characteristics of the samples for statistical significance to indicate their representativeness of a particular population, and; increasing the importance of confounding variables in research design (by identifying specific variables and selecting sample and control groups accordingly).

This particularly is true in relation to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where researchers often organize evidence by current interventions strategies rather than comprehensive models of IPV. Applying the concept of structural interventions to IPV, we systematically reviewed the quantitative impact of such interventions for prevention of male-to-female IPV in LMIC in order to (a) highlight current opportunities for IPV research and programming and (b) demonstrate how structural interventions may provide an organizing framework through which to build an evidence base for IPV prevention. Methods We identified articles by systematically searching PubMed and Web of Science, reviewing references of selected studies, and contacting 23 experts. Inclusion criteria included original research, written in English, published between January 2000 and May 2015 in the peer-reviewed literature. Studies evaluated the quantitative impact of structural interventions for the prevention of male-to-female IPV in LMIC through (a) IPV incidence or prevalence or (b) secondary outcomes theoretically linked to IPV by study authors. After initial screening, we evaluated full text articles for inclusion and extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias, using forms developed for the review. Results Twenty articles (16 studies) from nine countries met inclusion criteria, representing 13 randomized control trials and seven additional studies, all of which reported results from economic, social, or combined economic and social interventions. Standardized at p &lt; 0.05 or 95 % confidence intervals not including unity, 13 studies demonstrated statistically significant effects for at least one primary or secondary outcome, including decreased IPV and controlling behaviors; improved economic wellbeing; enhanced relationship quality, empowerment, or social capital; reduced acceptability of IPV; new help seeking behaviors; and more equitable gender norms. Risk of bias, however, varied in meaningful ways. Conclusions Our findings support the potential effectiveness of structural interventions for IPV prevention. Structural interventions, as an organizing framework, may advance IPV prevention by consolidating available evidence; highlighting opportunities to assess a broader range of interventions, including politico-legal and physical approaches; and emphasizing opportunities to improve evaluation of such interventions.",NA,Social protection,Social protection,Human development and gender,Gender,Social development and protection,Conflict prevention,Government and civil society,Government & Civil Society - General,Ending violence against women and girls,Other social infrastructure and services,Other Social Infrastructure & Services,Social services (incl youth development and women+ children),Good Health and Well-being | Gender Equality,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population,Sex | Socioeconomic status | Land ownership | Conflict-affected,"This review focuses on male-to-female intimate partner violence, which means it focuses on interventions aiming to improve outcomes for women.

One strength of this review is that they contacted authors of the included studies to comment on the manuscript findings, thus lending credibility to their interpretations and discussions. In addition, although they conducted/reported a descriptive review, they were careful to only choose the most saturated models and those that had conducted ITT analysis and they also used p&lt;.05 as the standard significance level when reporting the outcomes.

However, there remains uncertainty regarding the effects of these interventions on household air pollution concentrations, personal exposure concentrations and health outcomes. Objectives: The primary objective was to determine if household air pollution (HAP) interventions were associated with improved indoor air quality (IAQ) in households in LMICs. Given the potential impact of HAP interventions on health, a secondary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of HAP interventions to improve health in populations receiving these interventions. Data sources: OVID Medline, Ovid Embase, SCOPUS and PubMED were searched from their inception until December 2015 with no restrictions on study design. The WHO Global database of household air pollution measurements and Members' archives were also reviewed together with the reference lists of identified reviews and relevant articles. Study eligibility criteria, participants and intervention: We considered randomized controlled trials, or non-randomized control trials, or before-and-after studies; original studies; studies conducted in a LMIC (based on the United Nations Human Development Report released in March 2013 (World Bank, 2013); interventions that were explicitly aimed at improving IAQ and/or health from solid fuel use; studies published in a peer-reviewed journal or student theses or reports; studies that reported on outcomes which was indicative of IAQ or/and health. There was no restriction on the type of comparator (e.g. household receiving plancha vs. household using traditional cookstove) used in the intervention study. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Five review authors independently used pre-designed data collection forms to extract information from the original studies and assessed risk of bias using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). We computed standardized weighted mean difference (SMD) using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was computed using the Q and I2-statistics. We examined the influence of various characteristics on the study-specific effect estimates by stratifying the analysis by population type, study design, intervention type, and duration of exposure monitoring. The trim and fill method was used to assess the potential impact of missing studies. Results: Fifty-five studies met our a priori inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Fifteen studies provided 43 effect estimates for our meta-analysis. The largest improvement in HAP was observed for average particulate matter (PM) (SMD = 1.57) concentrations in household kitchens (1.03), followed by daily personal average concentrations of PM (1.18), and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in kitchens. With respect to personal PM, significant improvement was observed in studies of children (1.26) and studies monitoring PM for ≥ 24 h (1.32). This observation was also noted in terms of studies of kitchen concentrations of CO. A significant improvement was also observed for kitchen levels of PM in both adult populations (1.56) and in RCT/cohort designs (1.59) involving replacing cookstoves without chimneys. Our findings on health outcomes were inconclusive. Limitations, conclusions and implications of key findings: We observed high statistical between study variability in the study-specific estimate. Thus, care should be taken in concluding that HAP interventions - as currently designed and implemented - support reductions in the average kitchen and personal levels of PM and CO. Further, there is limited evidence that current stand-alone HAP interventions yield any health benefits. Post-intervention levels of pollutants were generally still greatly in excess of the relevant WHO guideline and thus a need to promote cleaner fuels in LMICs to reduce HAP levels below the WHO guidelines.",NA,Health,Health,Environment and natural resource management,Air quality management,Human development and gender,Child health,Energy,Energy Policy,Energy conservation and demand-side efficiency,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population | Sub-group analysis (other than sex),Sex,"A number of interventions evaluated and synthesized in this review are targeted at women, who are more affected by air pollution in the home.

Because most employment in low and middle income countries is in micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, governments, non-governmental organizations and donors spend on targeted programs and broader policies to enhance employment creation in these firms. But despite these efforts, not much is known about which of these interventions are really effective. This systematic review synthesizes the existing evidence on the employment impact of these programs. The results show that the effects have so far been very modest. Even if many interventions were relatively successful in boosting self-employment, expanding employment in already existing firms is generally more difficult but eventually easier in somewhat larger firms compared to very small firms. This finding is also true in relative terms, but it is probably not fully independent from the contexts in which firms of different sizes have been observed. The effects of finance interventions have on average been weaker than the effects of entrepreneurship training or business development services. Our study also reveals that about a third of the interventions covered by this review are not primarily designed to create employment but rather strive for income stabilization and poverty reduction. A further striking finding is that the study design matters for the impacts found; randomized controlled trials find systematically smaller effects than quasi-experimental studies. A significant shortcoming of the literature is that almost nothing is known about long term effects and cost-effectiveness and many studies fail to provide a detailed analysis of why certain effects occurred or did not occur — making it hard to extrapolate lessons.",NA,Social protection,Social protection,Urban and rural development,Rural non-farm income generation,Private sector development,Job creation,Other social infrastructure and services,Other Social Infrastructure & Services,Employment creation,NA,NA,NA,No Poverty | Decent Work and Economic Growth,NA,Cash transfers | Microfinance,Equity sensitive analytical framework | Intervention targets vulnerable population,Sex,"Authors include a number of studies targeting women specifically and compare the effect of these studies vs those targeting any gender.

Little is known about which interventions are most effective.","To synthesise the evidence on the impact of interventions aiming to increase employment in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.",We are in the process of completing a summary for this review. Please check back later,"The authors included 53 studies: 27 quasi-experimental designs and 26 randomized controlled trials. Latin American countries have long implemented (and evaluated) labour market policies, and this was reflected in the number of studies included from Latin America and the Caribbean (29 studies). Studies were also conducted in South Asia (10 studies), sub-Saharan Africa (9 studies), East Asia and the Pacific (3 studies), Europe and Central Asia (5 studies) and Middle East and North Africa (2 studies), with some studies conducted in more than one region. The majority of studies (36 studies) focused on micro-enterprises or self-employment. About one-third of the interventions included in the review did not have employment creation as the primary aim; rather, employment creation was an additional outcome of programs that attempted to reduce poverty or stabilise incomes.","Programmes that provide finance and/or training are successful at improving intermediate outcomes such as management skills or investment, but such programmes had only modest effects on job creation. However, providing training or assistance with business development is more effective than providing finance alone (although these results come from small and medium-size enterprises in Latin America and may not be applicable in other contexts). Programmes to promote formalisation (encouraging enterprises to register with the tax authority and operate within the regulations) have also had overall positive effects on employment in Brazil and Mexico. The best incentive to formalise appears to be offering benefits, such as public services. Encouraging enterprises to formalise is difficult, however, and debate remains about the size of the effects. Programmes are more successful at creating employment in micro-enterprises (often self-employment) than at expanding employment in existing companies.","The authors note that many of the randomised controlled trials did not have a sample size sufficiently large to detect small changes in outcomes. In addition to methodological improvements, the authors call for future studies to provide more detail and analysis on why outcomes did or did not occur so that lessons can be learned. They note that more research is required in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and on long-term effects and cost-effectiveness.","The authors included studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs to examine the relationship between a programme or policy intervention and job creation in micro-enterprises (fewer than five workers), small enterprises (5-19 workers) and medium enterprises (between 20 and 250 workers) in low and middle income countries. Job creation was defined as both the emergence of new jobs in existing enterprises, and jobs that arise through the creation of new enterprises, including self-employment. Studies on farming and employment on farms were excluded. The search was conducted in February 2013, with a second, more specific search in June 2013. The authors screened electronic databases, relevant websites and key journals. They also searched the references of included papers and contacted researchers and key experts to identify additional papers. The authors included unpublished studies (contacting authors of ongoing studies to see if results were available for inclusion in the review) and papers published after 1990 in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and German. The authors present both a narrative review and a meta-regression analysis.","Yes, they used a systematic approach/methodology","The authors discussed the variability between studies, including the differences in outcomes by study design. RCTs had less positive results than QED's, although the authors noted that this could be due to either selection bias or to the types of problems to which RCTs are applied resulting in low power to detect effects. Also discussed is that there is a lack of detail on why certain effects did/not occur, cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and the long term effects of programs, so the authors caution against making firm conclusions about causality. The authors propose a potential theory of change along a causal chain prior to discussing their results and attempt to link programs to intermediate outcomes to final outcomes. They collect some study design detail to discuss internal and external validity and include only the QEDs with the highest potential validity: propensity score matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-difference estimation. They also noted the potential problem with RCTs in this review, in that they were typically implemented with a small number of participants and are much less likely to be scaled to a larger scale or implemented in a different context.

The report of effect sizes prior to the meta-regression is essentially a ""vote-counting"" procedure of negative, small, medium, and large effect sizes by outcomes, which is problematic. Also, they combine significant/non-significant effects for the negative effect size category. It seems that they should have conducted a traditional meta-analysis (even split into separate models for each similar type of effect size and outcome) rather than a presentation of effect sizes as they have done, prior to moving onto the meta-regression models.

to establishing loan funds (De Costa et al. 2009), another
established a revolving petrol fund (Shehu et al. 1997), seven
set up loan funds with emergency transport schemes (Essien
et al. 1997; Olaniran et al. 1997; Opoku et al. 1997; Lungu et al.
2004; Manandhar et al. 2004; Rana et al. 2007; Ahluwalia et al.
2010), whereas the other three studies established loan funds
only (Chiwuzie et al. 1997; Fofana et al. 1997; Hossain and Ross
2006). All the studies also included other interventions such as
upgrading and establishment of EmOC facilities, health education
and training of health workers and Traditional Birth
Attendants/Village Health Workers.
The majority of the studies required community members to
contribute their own cash either upfront or as a revolving
approach where users of the loan had to reimburse the fund.
Two of the studies (Shehu et al. 1997; De Costa et al. 2009)
describe a grant being given to the community to start the
fund. It was not always clearly stated who instigated the fund
collection, how the funds were managed or which members of
the community were expected to contribute.(pg 949)",Index of health finance,"Uptake of community-based loan funds -- Uptake of community-based loan funds -- Uptake of community loan funds: Uptake was described in different ways across the studies. In Nigeria, only nine loan funds were used out of the 20 established (Olaniran et al. 1997). In Sierra Leone, there was an attempt to establish loan funds in six chiefdoms, but only
two were successful (Fofana et al. 1997). In an intervention in India, despite funds being made freely available for transport to EmOC facilities and incentives given for registration of pregnancies, only 24% of women requiring referral used the transport fund (De Costa et al. 2009). The authors attribute this to a lack of trust in health facilities with respect to quality of care. Other studies (Chiwuzie et al. 1997; Essien et al. 1997; Shehu et al. 1997) reported a high uptake of community-based loan funds.

We undertook a systematic review to assess and synthesize the existing evidence in the scientific literature on the health impacts of these investments. Methods and findings We systematically searched databases for peer-reviewed and grey literature, using tailored search strategies. We screened studies for study design and relevance, using predefined inclusion criteria, and selected those that enabled us to link health outcomes or impact to increased external funding. For all included studies, we recorded dataset and study characteristics, health outcomes and impacts. We analysed the data using a causal-chain framework to develop a narrative summary of the published evidence. Thirteen articles, representing 11 individual studies set in Africa and Asia reporting impacts on HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, met the inclusion criteria. Only two of these studies documented the entire causal-chain spanning from funding to programme scale-up, to outputs, outcomes and impacts. Nonetheless, overall we find a positive correlation between consecutive steps in the causal chain, suggesting that external funds for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria programmes contributed to improved health outcomes and impact. Conclusions Despite the large number of supported programmes worldwide and despite an abundance of published studies on HIV, TB and malaria control, we identified very few eligible studies that adequately demonstrated the full process by which external funding has been translated to health impact. Most of these studies did not move beyond demonstrating statistical association, as opposed to contribution or causation. We thus recommend that funding organizations and researchers increase the emphasis on ensuring data capture along the causal pathway to demonstrate effect and contribution of external financing.

Effective coordination between organizations, agencies and bodies providing or financing health services in humanitarian crises is required to ensure efficiency of services, avoid duplication, and improve equity. The objective of this review was to assess how, during and after humanitarian crises, different mechanisms and models of coordination between organizations, agencies and bodies providing or financing health services compare in terms of access to health services and health outcomes.

Methods
We registered a protocol for this review in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews under number PROSPERO2014:CRD42014009267. Eligible studies included randomized and nonrandomized designs, process evaluations and qualitative methods. We electronically searched Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the WHO Global Health Library and websites of relevant organizations. We followed standard systematic review methodology for the selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Results
Of 14,309 identified citations from databases and organizations' websites, we identified four eligible studies. Two studies used mixed-methods, one used quantitative methods, and one used qualitative methods. The available evidence suggests that information coordination between bodies providing health services in humanitarian crises settings may be effective in improving health systems inputs. There is additional evidence suggesting that management/directive coordination such as the cluster model may improve health system inputs in addition to access to health services. None of the included studies assessed coordination through common representation and framework coordination. The evidence was judged to be of very low quality.

Conclusion
This systematic review provides evidence of possible effectiveness of information coordination and management/directive coordination between organizations, agencies and bodies providing or financing health services in humanitarian crises.

This review overcomes the limitations of previous studies by considering a larger evidence base and exploring time as one of the agriculture-nutrition pathways. Agricultural development plays a role in improving nutrition. However, agricultural practices and interventions determine the amount of time dedicated to agricultural and domestic work. Time spent in agriculture—especially by women—competes with time needed for resting, childcare, and food preparation and can have unintended negative consequences for nutrition. The findings of this systematic review confirm previous conclusions about the gendered nature and impact of agricultural practices and interventions. However, the results contradict the assumption that rural residents in low- and middle-income countries have surplus labor time. In particular, the evidence shows that • women play a key role in agriculture, and this is reflected in their time commitments to these activities, whether as farmers or as farmworkers; • women are important actors in the uptake and response to agricultural interventions; and • agricultural interventions tend to increase women’s, men’s, and children’s time burdens. However, the studies included in this review do not provide clear-cut evidence on the nutritional implications of agricultural practices and interventions, even when these result in increased time spent on agricultural activities. Nutritional impacts are varied because households and household members respond to increased time burden and workload in different ways. Why are responses different? It depends on a number of important differentiating factors that include income and the possibility of purchasing food, household socioeconomic status more generally, household type and composition (in particular the presence of members who can take up domestic work), and the type of indicator used to assess food consumption, security, or nutrition. Therefore different sets of policies are needed to address specific forms of burden management, shouldered by households, individual household members, or both.

Adolescents often have repeat pregnancies within a year of giving birth. Women may receive counseling on family planning both antepartum and postpartum. Decisions about contraceptive use made right after counseling may differ considerably from actual postpartum use. In earlier work, we found limited evidence of effectiveness from randomized trials on postpartum contraceptive counseling. For educational interventions, non-randomized studies may be conducted more often than randomized trials. Objectives: We reviewed non-randomized studies of educational strategies to improve postpartum contraceptive use. Our intent was to examine associations between specific interventions and postpartum contraceptive use or subsequent pregnancy. Search methods: We searched for eligible non-randomized studies until 3 November 2014. Sources included CENTRAL, PubMed, POPLINE, and Web of Science. We also sought current trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. For additional citations, we examined reference lists of relevant reports and reviews. Selection criteria: The studies had to be comparative, i.e., have intervention and comparison groups. The educational component could be counseling or another behavioral strategy to improve contraceptive use among postpartum women. The intervention had to include contact within six weeks postpartum. The comparison condition could be another behavioral strategy to improve contraceptive use, usual care, other health education, or no intervention. Our primary outcomes were postpartum contraceptive use and subsequent pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: Two authors evaluated abstracts for eligibility and extracted data from included studies. We computed the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous measures, both with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Where studies used adjusted analyses for continuous outcomes, we presented the results as reported by the investigators. Due to differences in interventions and outcome measures, we did not conduct meta-analysis. To assess the evidence quality, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Main results: Six studies met our inclusion criteria and included a total of 5143 women. Of three studies with self-reported pregnancy data, two showed pregnancy to be less likely in the experimental group than in the comparison group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.87) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.87). The interventions included a clinic-based counseling program and a community-based communication project.All studies showed some association of the intervention with contraceptive use. Two showed that treatment-group women were more likely to use a modern method than the control group: ORs were 1.77 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.89) and 3.08 (95% CI 2.36 to 4.02). In another study, treatment-group women were more likely than control-group women to use pills (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.50) or an intrauterine device (IUD) (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.27 to 10.86) but less likely to use and injectable method (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.00). One study used a score for method effectiveness. The methods of the special-intervention group scored higher than those of the comparison group at three months (MD 13.26, 95% CI 3.16 to 23.36). A study emphasizing IUDs showed women in the intervention group were more likely to use an IUD (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.69) and less likely to use no method (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75). In another study, contraceptive use was more likely among women in a health service intervention compared to women in a community awareness program at four months (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.30) or women receiving standard care at 10 to 12 months (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.74). That study was the only one with a specific component on the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) that had sufficient data on LAM use. Women in the health service group were more likely than those in the community awareness group to use LAM (OR 41.36, 95% CI 10.11 to 169.20). Authors' conclusions: We considered the quality of evidence to be very low. The studies had limitations in design, analysis, or reporting. Three did not adjust for potential confounding and only two had sufficient information on intervention fidelity. Outcomes were self reported and definitions varied for contraceptive use.

The report had to describe the strategy content or process. Counseling described as standard or routine was not considered sufficient for the 'test' or 'experimental' condition.

Design Systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Methods 19 electronic databases were searched with a highly sensitive prespecified strategy and the grey literature examined, completed July 2016. Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions to improve CHW performance in low- and middle-income countries were included and appraised for risk of bias. Outcomes were biological and behavioural patient outcomes (primary), use of health services, quality of care provided by CHWs and CHW retention (secondary). Results Two reviewers screened 8082 records; 14 evaluations were included. Due to heterogeneity and lack of clear outcome data, no meta-analysis was conducted. Results were presented in a narrative summary. The review found one study showing no effect on the biological outcomes of interest, though these moderate quality data may not be indicative of all biological outcomes. It also found moderate quality evidence of the efficacy of performance improvement interventions for (1) improving behavioural outcomes for patients, (2) improving use of services by increasing the absolute number of patients who access services and, perhaps, better identifying those who would benefit from such services and (3) improving CHW quality of care in terms of upstream measures like completion of prescribed activities and downstream measures like adherence to treatment protocols. Nearly half of studies were compound interventions, making it difficult to isolate the effects of individual performance improvement intervention components, though four specific strategies pertaining to recruitment, supervision, incentivisation and equipment were identified. Conclusions Variations in recruitment, supervision, incentivisation and equipment may improve CHW performance. Practitioners should, however, assess the relevance and feasibility of these strategies in their health setting prior to implementation.

Women may stay in the MWH at the end of their pregnancy and await labour. Once labour starts, women move to the health facility so that labour and giving birth can be assisted by a skilled birth attendant. The aim of the MWH is to improve accessibility to skilled care and thus reduce morbidity and mortality for mother and neonate should complications arise. Some studies report a favourable effect on the outcomes for women and their newborns. Others show that utilisation is low and barriers exist. However, these data are limited in their reliability. Objectives To assess the effects of a maternity waiting facility on maternal and perinatal health. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 January 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), CINAHL (1982 to January 2012), African Journals Online (AJOL) (January 2012), POPLINE (January 2012), Dissertation Abstracts (January 2012) and reference lists of retrieved papers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials including quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials that compared perinatal and maternal outcome in women using a MWH and women who did not. Data collection and analysis There were no randomised controlled trials or cluster‐randomised trials identified from the search.

Women stay in the MWH at the end of their pregnancy and await labour. Once labour starts, women move to the health facility so they can be assisted by a skilled birth attendant (WHO 1991; WHO 2004). There are many ways in which this concept is being implemented. In Zimbabwe and Ethiopia traditional style huts are used (Millard 1991; Poovan 1990); but also modern houses with toilet, bathroom and kitchen facilities (Cardoso 1986; Knowles 1988); old hospital wards (Wilson 1997); or, as in Papua New Guinea, a house on stilts may function as a MWH (Barss 1985). The way women are cared for diIers from country to country. Some facilities are completely self-catering and women provide their own food, water and firewood. Others are completely catered for, and sometimes the economic status of the women determines whether she is provided with food or not. When staying in the MWH, women have access to antenatal care. They may visit the routine antenatal care program in the health facility but more women the MWH is visited regularly by a nurse, midwife or doctor. When the time women spend in the MWH is also used to give health education about pregnancy, giving birth and neonatal care. The costs of a MWH are covered in diIerent ways. Communities have been involved in building huts while ministries of health or non-governmental organisations contribute to building costs. Running costs may be partly covered by user fees, and by fundraising projects co-ordinated by the waiting women (Eckermann 2008; Poovan 1990; Wessel 1990; Wilson 1997).

These strategies include interventions in which information is aimed at larger groups in the community, for instance at public meetings, through radio or through leaflets. This is one of two reviews on communication interventions for childhood vaccination. The companion review focuses on face-to-face interventions for informing or educating parents. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate people about vaccination in children six years and younger. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and five other databases up to July 2012. We searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey.We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. There were no language, date or settings restrictions. Selection criteria Individual or cluster-randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series (ITS) and repeated measures studies, and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies. We included interventions aimed at communities and intended to inform and/or educate about vaccination in children six years and younger, conducted in any setting.We defined interventions aimed at communities as those directed at a geographic area, and/or interventions directed to groups of people who share at least one common social or cultural characteristic. Primary outcomes were: knowledge among participants of vaccines or vaccine-preventable diseases and of vaccine service delivery; child immunisation status; and unintended adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were: participants’ attitudes towards vaccination; involvement in decision-making regarding vaccination; confidence in the decision made; and resource use or cost of intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed the references to identify studies for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed risk of bias in all included studies. Main results We included two cluster-randomised trials that compared interventions aimed at communities to routine immunisation practices. In one study from India, families, teachers, children and village leaders were encouraged to attend information meetings where they received information about childhood vaccination and could ask questions. In the second study from Pakistan, people who were considered to be trusted in the community were invited to meetings to discuss vaccine coverage rates in their community and the costs and benefits of childhood vaccination. They were asked to develop local action plans and to share the information they had been given and continue the discussions in their communities. The trials show low certainty evidence that interventions aimed at communities to inform and educate about childhood vaccination may improve knowledge of vaccines or vaccine-preventable diseases among intervention participants (adjusted mean difference 0.121, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.055 to 0.189). These interventions probably increase the number of children who are vaccinated. The study from India showed that the intervention probably increased the number of children who received vaccinations (risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.31; moderate certainty evidence). The study from Pakistan showed that there is probably an increase in the uptake of both measles (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.58) and DPT (diptheria, pertussis and tetanus) (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.29) vaccines (both moderate certainty evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the number of children who received polio vaccine (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05; low certainty evidence). There is also low certainty evidence that these interventions may change attitudes in favour of vaccination among parents with young children (adjusted mean difference 0.054, 95% CI 0.013 to 0.105), but they may make little or no difference to the involvement of mothers in decision-making regarding childhood vaccination (adjusted mean difference 0.043, 95% CI -0.009 to 0.097). The studies did not assess knowledge among participants of vaccine service delivery; participant confidence in the vaccination decision; intervention costs; or any unintended harms as a consequence of the intervention. We did not identify any studies that compared interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate with interventions directed to individual parents or caregivers, or studies that compared two interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate about childhood vaccination. Authors’ conclusions This review provides limited evidence that interventions aimed at communities to informand educate about early childhood vaccination may improve attitudes towards vaccination and probably increase vaccination uptake under some circumstances. However, some of these interventions may be resource intensive when implemented on a large scale and further rigorous evaluations are needed. These interventions may achieve most benefit when targeted to areas or groups that have low childhood vaccination rates.’",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Child health,NA,NA,Health,Basic Health,Health education,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Community driven development,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not applicable,Vaccination | Community | Parents | Caregivers | Early Childhood,NA,South Asia,Pakistan,Lower middle income,No,Electoral autocracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Other tool (Non-randomized studies),Not applicable,"No overall quality assessment provided  We assessed and reported on the methodological risk of bias of included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011),",NA,Government agency,Research Council of Norway,NA,2,Not reported,Not reported,General health education and behaviour change,"[""Interventions aimed at communities to inform and\/or educate""] -- We included interventions aimed at communities, with a broad audience and purpose (see definition below) and that were intended to inform and/or educate about vaccination in children six years and younger.

Parental smoking is a common source of children's exposure to ETS. Older children in child care or educational settings are also at risk of exposure to ETS. Preventing exposure to ETS during infancy and childhood has significant potential to improve children's health worldwide. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register and conducted additional searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Education Resource Information Center (ERIC), and the Social Science Citation Index & Science Citation Index (Web of Knowledge). We conducted the most recent search in February 2017. Selection criteria: We included controlled trials, with or without random allocation, that enrolled participants (parents and other family members, child care workers, and teachers) involved in the care and education of infants and young children (from birth to 12 years of age). All mechanisms for reducing children's ETS exposure were eligible, including smoking prevention, cessation, and control programmes. These include health promotion, social-behavioural therapies, technology, education, and clinical interventions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies and extracted data. Due to heterogeneity of methods and outcome measures, we did not pool results but instead synthesised study findings narratively. Main results: Seventy-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and we assessed all evidence to be of low or very low quality based on GRADE assessment. We judged nine studies to be at low risk of bias, 35 to have unclear overall risk of bias, and 34 to have high risk of bias. Twenty-one interventions targeted populations or community settings, 27 studies were conducted in the well-child healthcare setting and 26 in the ill-child healthcare setting. Two further studies conducted in paediatric clinics did not make clear whether visits were made to well- or ill-children, and another included visits to both well- and ill-children. Forty-five studies were reported from North America, 22 from other high-income countries, and 11 from low- or middle-income countries. Only 26 of the 78 studies reported a beneficial intervention effect for reduction of child ETS exposure, 24 of which were statistically significant. Of these 24 studies, 13 used objective measures of children's ETS exposure. We were unable to pinpoint what made these programmes effective. Studies showing a significant effect used a range of interventions: nine used in-person counselling or motivational interviewing; another study used telephone counselling, and one used a combination of in-person and telephone counselling; three used multi-component counselling-based interventions; two used multi-component education-based interventions; one used a school-based strategy; four used educational interventions, including one that used picture books; one used a smoking cessation intervention; one used a brief intervention; and another did not describe the intervention. Of the 52 studies that did not show a significant reduction in child ETS exposure, 19 used more intensive counselling approaches, including motivational interviewing, education, coaching, and smoking cessation brief advice. Other interventions consisted of brief advice or counselling (10 studies), feedback of a biological measure of children's ETS exposure (six studies), nicotine replacement therapy (two studies), feedback of maternal cotinine (one study), computerised risk assessment (one study), telephone smoking cessation support (two studies), educational home visits (eight studies), group sessions (one study), educational materials (three studies), and school-based policy and health promotion (one study). Some studies employed more than one intervention. 35 of the 78 studies reported a reduction in ETS exposure for children, irrespective of assignment to intervention and comparison groups. One study did not aim to reduce children's tobacco smoke exposure but rather sought to reduce symptoms of asthma, and found a significant reduction in symptoms among the group exposed to motivational interviewing. We found little evidence of difference in effectiveness of interventions between the well infant, child respiratory illness, and other child illness settings as contexts for parental smoking cessation interventions. Authors' conclusions: A minority of interventions have been shown to reduce children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and improve children's health, but the features that differentiate the effective interventions from those without clear evidence of effectiveness remain unclear. The evidence was judged to be of low or very low quality, as many of the trials are at a high risk of bias, are small and inadequately powered, with heterogeneous interventions and populations.",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Child health,Human development and gender,Non-communicable diseases,Health,Basic Health,Basic health care,Health,Basic Health,Health education,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Not applicable,Intervention targets vulnerable population,Age,Children,Family And Carer Smoking Control Programme | Child | Exposure | Environmental Tobacco Smoke,NA,Europe and Central Asia,Italy,High income,No,Liberal democracy,NA,Effectiveness,NA,Narrative/thematic synthesis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,"""Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of bias, 27 studies were judged to have unclear overall risk of bias and 23 studies were judged to have high risk of bias"" See page 2-- Selected unclear as medium Quality.

This study investigates interventions to achieve this where traditional birth attendants were providers of childbirth care and asks what has been done and what has worked? Methods and Findings We systematically reviewed published and unpublished literature, searching 2 databases and contacting experts to find relevant studies. We included references from all time periods and locations. 132 items from 41 countries met our inclusion criteria and are included in an inventory; six were intervention evaluations of high or moderate quality which we further analysed. Four studies report on interventions to deploy midwives closer to communities: two studies in Indonesia reported an increase in use of skilled health personnel; another Indonesian study showed increased uptake of caesarean sections as midwives per population increased; one study in Bangladesh reported decreased risk of maternal death. Two studies report on interventions to address financial barriers: one in Bangladesh reported an increase in use of skilled health personnel where financial barriers for users were addressed and incentives were given to skilled care providers; another in Peru reported that use of emergency obstetric care increased by subsidies for preventive and maternity care, but not by improved quality of care. Conclusions The interventions had positive outcomes for relevant maternal health indicators. However, three of the studies evaluate the village midwife programme in Indonesia, which limits the generalizability of conclusions. Most studies report on a main intervention, despite other activities, such as community mobilization or partnerships with traditional birth attendants.

A growing body of literature indicates that stunting can have negative repercussions on physical and cognitive development. There are increasing concerns that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly susceptible to adverse consequences of stunting on economic development. The aim of this review is to synthesize current evidence on interventions and policies that have had success in reducing stunting and explore the impact of successes on economic indicators.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;This review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles were searched through MEDLINE via PubMed and Ovid, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and ProQuest. Only articles that addressed the effects of nutrition and cash-based interventions and/or policies on stunting and reported effects on childhood mortality and/or human capital indicators were included. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed quality.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Seventeen studies from Africa (47%), South America (41%), and South Asia (12%) met the eligibility criteria: 8 cohort studies, 4 case studies, 4 Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) and 1 quasi-trial. Three types of interventions/policies were evaluated: multisectoral policies, nutritional supplementations and cash-based interventions (CCT). Overall, 76% of the included studies were successful in reducing stunting and 65% of interventions/policies reported successes on stunting reductions and economic successes. Five of the 11 successful studies reported on nutritional supplementation, 4 reported on multisectoral policies, and 2 reported on CCT interventions. Average Annual Rate of Reduction (AARR) was calculated to assess the impact of multisectoral policies on childhood mortality. AARR for under 5 mortality ranged from 5.2 to 6.2% and all countries aligned with the global target of 4.4% AARR. Quality assessment yielded positive results, with the biggest concerns being attrition bias for cohort studies, blinding for trials and generalizability of results for case studies.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Evidence suggests that investment in fighting chronic malnutrition through multisectoral policies, multi-year nutritional supplementation (protein or multiple micronutrient supplementation) and possibly CCTs can have a long-term impact on economic development of LMICs. More evidence is needed to inform practices in non-represented regions while prioritizing standardization of economic indicators in the literature.

Within the field of health promotion, CTs constitute a healthy public policy initiative as they have the potential to address the social determinants of health (SDoH) and health inequalities. A systematic review was conducted to synthesise the evidence on CTs' impacts on SDoH and health inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa, and to identify the barriers and facilitators of effective CTs. Twenty-one electronic databases and the websites of 14 key organizations were searched in addition to grey literature and hand searching of selected journals for quantitative and qualitative studies on CTs' impacts on SDoH and health outcomes. Out of 182 full texts screened for eligibility, 79 reports that reported findings from 53 studies were included in the final review. The studies were undertaken within 24 CTs comprising 11 unconditional CTs (UCTs), 8 conditional CTs (CCTs) and 5 combined UCTs and CCTs. The review found that CTs can be effective in tackling structural determinants of health such as financial poverty, education, household resilience, child labour, social capital and social cohesion, civic participation, and birth registration. The review further found that CTs modify intermediate determinants such as nutrition, dietary diversity, child deprivation, sexual risk behaviours, teen pregnancy and early marriage. In conjunction with their influence on SDoH, there is moderate evidence from the review that CTs impact on health and quality of life outcomes. The review also found many factors relating to intervention design features, macro-economic stability, household dynamics and community acceptance of programs that could influence the effectiveness of CTs. The external validity of the review findings is strong as the findings are largely consistent with those from Latin America.

Improving complementary diets of children aged 6-23 mo is a recommended approach for reducing stunting in children &lt;5 y old. Less is known about the potential of these interventions to prevent wasting.Objective: The aim of this article was to review and synthesize the current literature for the impact of complementary feeding interventions on linear [length-for-age z score (LAZ)] and ponderal [weight-for-length z score (WLZ)] growth of children aged 6-23 mo, with the specific goal of updating intervention-outcome linkages in the Lives Saved Tool (LiST).Methods: We started our review with studies included in the previous LiST review and searched for articles published since January 2012. We identified longitudinal trials that compared children aged 6-23 mo who received 1 of 2 types of complementary feeding interventions (nutrition education or counseling alone or complementary food supplementation with or without nutrition education or counseling) with a no-intervention control. We assessed study quality and generated pooled estimates of LAZ and WLZ change, as well as length and weight gain, for each category of intervention.Results: Interventions that provided nutrition education or counseling had a small but significant impact on linear growth in food-secure populations [LAZ standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.22] but not on ponderal growth. Complementary food supplementation interventions with or without nutrition education also had a small, significant effect in food-insecure settings on both LAZ (SMD: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.13) and WLZ (SMD: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.08).Conclusions: Nutrition education and complementary feeding interventions both had a small but significant impact on linear growth, and complementary feeding interventions also had an impact on ponderal growth of children aged 6-23 mo in low- and middle-income countries. The updated LiST model will support nutrition program planning and evaluation efforts by allowing users to model changes in intervention coverage on both stunting and wasting.

We extracted study characteristics, interventions and outcomes data. Study quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were conducted in Africa (17), during periods of conflict or hunger gaps (14), and evaluated micronutrient supplementation (14) or selective feeding (10). Overall study quality was low, with only two high and four moderate quality studies. High- and medium-quality studies demonstrated positive impact of fortified spreads, ready-to-use therapeutic foods, micronutrient supplementation, and food and cash transfers. CONCLUSION: In disasters and complex emergencies, high variability and low quality of controlled studies on paediatric malnutrition limit meaningful data aggregation. If existing research gaps are to be addressed, the inherent unpredictability of humanitarian emergencies and ethical considerations regarding controls may warrant a paradigm shift in what constitutes adequate methods. Periodic hunger gaps may offer a generalisable opportunity for robust trials, but consensus on meaningful nutritional endpoints is needed.",15,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Nutrition,Not applicable,Not applicable,Health,"Health, General",Basic nutrition,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Cash transfers,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not Applicable,adolescents; Africa; aggregation; animals; anthropometric dimensions; assessment; body measurements; children; Chordata; efficacy; emergencies;  ethics; eukaryotes; evaluation; feeding; food; foods; guidelines; health; Hominidae; Homo; human diseases; hunger; infants; malnutrition; mammals; man; morbidity; mortality; primates; randomized controlled trials; research; systematic reviews; vertebrates,10,East Asia and Pacific,China,Upper middle income,No,Closed autocracy,10,Effectiveness,NA,Not applicable,NA,Not applicable,NA,Other,"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)",NA,5,Not specified,Not specified,2,31,2,4,Nutrient fortification in foods,"""fortified spreads; fortified foods, p1467-1472

This systematic review examined high quality evidence from 35 citizen engagement programmes in low‐ and middle‐income countries that promote the engagement of citizens in service delivery through four routes: participation (participatory priority setting); inclusion of marginalised groups; transparency (information on rights and public service performance), and/or citizen efforts to ensure public service accountability (citizen feedback and monitoring); collectively, PITA mechanisms. We collected quantitative and qualitative data from the included studies and used statistical meta‐analysis and realist‐informed framework synthesis to analyse the findings. Results The findings suggest that interventions promoting citizen engagement by improving direct engagement between service users and service providers, are often effective in stimulating active citizen engagement in service delivery and realising improvements in access to services and quality of service provision, particularly for services that involve direct interaction between citizens and providers. However, in the absence of complementary interventions to address bottlenecks around service provider supply chains and service use, citizen engagement interventions alone may not improve key wellbeing outcomes for target communities or state‐society relations. In addition, interventions promoting citizen engagement by increasing citizen pressures on politicians to hold providers to account, are not usually able to influence service delivery. Conclusions The citizen engagement interventions studied were more likely to be successful: (1) where the programme targeted a service that citizens access directly from front‐line staff, such as healthcare, as opposed to services accessed independently of service provider staff, such as roads; (2) where implementers were able to generate active support and buy‐in for the intervention from both citizens and front‐line public service staff and officials; and (3) where the implementation approach drew on and/or stimulated local capacity for collective action. From a research perspective, the review found few studies that investigated the impact of these interventions on women or other vulnerable groups within communities, and that rigorous impact evaluations often lack adequately transparent reporting, particularly of information on what interventions actually did and how conditions compared to those in comparison communities.",NA,Social protection,Public admin - Social protection,Public sector management,"Transparency, accountability and good governance",NA,NA,Government and civil society,Government & Civil Society - General,Democratic participation and civil society,NA,NA,NA,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,NA,Not applicable,Sub-group analysis by sex | Sub-group analysis (other than sex),Sex | Socioeconomic status,"Across the whole pool of included studies, 12 conducted sub-group analysis to differentiate impacts for different population groups, most commonly by socioeconomic status and by sex of participant, yet these were spread widely across intervention type and geography.

This review reports findings on a systematic review analysing effectiveness of preventive interventions delivered by Community Health Workers for Maternal and Child Health in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: A search strategy was developed according to the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre’s (EPPI-Centre) guidelines and systematic searching of the following databases occurred between June 8 – 11th, 2012: CINAHL, Embase, Ovid Nursing Database, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and POPLINE. Google, Google Scholar and WHO search engines, as well as relevant systematic reviews and reference lists from included articles were also searched. Inclusion criteria were: i) Target beneficiaries should be pregnant or recently pregnant women and/or children under-5 and/or caregivers of children under-5; ii) Interventions were required to be preventive and delivered by Community Health Workers at the household level. No exclusion criteria were stipulated for comparisons/controls or outcomes. Study characteristics of included articles were extracted using a data sheet and a peer tested quality assessment. A narrative synthesis of included studies was compiled with articles being coded descriptively to synthesise results and draw conclusions. Results: A total of 10,281 studies were initially identified and through the screening process a total of 17 articles detailing 19 studies were included in the review. Studies came from ten different countries and consisted of randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized controlled trials, before and after, case control and cross sectional studies. Overall quality of evidence was found to be moderate. Five main preventive intervention categories emerged: malaria prevention, health education, breastfeeding promotion, essential newborn care and psychosocial support. All categories showed some evidence for the effectiveness of Community Health Workers; however they were found to be especially effective in promoting mother-performed strategies (skin to skin care and exclusive breastfeeding). Conclusions: Community Health Workers were shown to provide a range of preventive interventions for Maternal and Child Health in low- and middle-income countries with some evidence of effective strategies, though insufficient evidence is available to draw conclusions for most interventions and further research is needed",NA,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Malaria control,Human development and gender,Health service delivery,Health,Basic Health,Health personnel development,Population policies/programmes and reproductive health,Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,Reproductive health care,Good Health and Well-being,NA,Community driven development,Intervention targets vulnerable population,Other | Age,"Include women pregnant to 42 days

According to an estimate, 19.4% of children &lt;5 years of age in developing countries were underweight (weight-for-age Z score &lt;-2) and about 29.9% were stunted in the year 2011 (height-for-age Z score &lt;-2). It is well recognized that the period of 6-24 months of age is one of the most critical time for the growth of the infant.Methods:&nbsp;We included randomized, non-randomized trials and programs on the effect of complementary feeding (CF) (fortified or unfortified, but not micronutrients alone) and education on CF on children less than 2 years of age in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Studies that delivered intervention for at least 6 months were included; however, studies in which intervention was given for supplementary and therapeutic purposes were excluded. Recommendations are made for input to the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) model by following standardized guidelines developed by Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG).Results:&nbsp;We included 16 studies in this review. Amongst these, 9 studies provided education on complementary feeding, 6 provided complementary feeding (with our without education) and 1 provided both as separate arms. Overall, education on CF alone significantly improved HAZ (SMD: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.36), WAZ (SMD 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.27), and significantly reduced the rates of stunting (RR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.91). While no significant impact were observed for height and weight gain. Based on the subgroup analysis; ten studies from food secure populations indicated education on CF had a significant impact on height gain, HAZ scores, and weight gain, however, stunting reduced non-significantly. In food insecure population, CF education alone significantly improved HAZ scores, WAZ scores and significantly reduced the rates of stunting, while CF provision with or without education improved HAZ and WAZ scores significantly.Conclusion:&nbsp;Complementary feeding interventions have a potential to improve the nutritional status of children in developing countries. However, large scale high quality randomized controlled trials are required to assess the actual impact of this intervention on growth and morbidity in children 6-24 months of age.

The impact of food supplementation on child growth merits careful evaluation in view of the reliance of many states and non-governmental organisations on this intervention to improve child health in low and middle income countries (LMIC). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.Objectives:&nbsp;To evaluate the effectiveness of community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the physical growth of children under five years of age in LMIC.Search methods:&nbsp;For this updated review we searched the following databases on 31 January 2011: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (1948 to January week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to week 3, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to 27 January 2011), LILACS (all years), WorldCat for dissertations and theses (all years) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years).Selection criteria:&nbsp;Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating supplementary feeding in comparison to a control group (no intervention or a placebo such as food with a very low number of nutrients and calories) in children from birth to five years of age in LMIC.Data collection and analysis:&nbsp;Two review authors independently extracted and analysed the data.Main results:&nbsp;We included eight RCTs (n = 1243 children) that were at relatively high risk of bias. We found high levels of clinical heterogeneity in the participants, interventions and outcome measures across studies. Nevertheless, in order to quantify pooled effects of supplementary feeding, we decided to combine studies according to prespecified characteristics. These were the children's age (younger or older than 24 months), their nutritional status at baseline (stunted or wasted, or not stunted or wasted) and the duration of the intervention (less or more than 12 months). A statistically significant difference of effect was only found for length during the intervention in children aged less than 12 months (two studies; 795 children; mean difference 0.19 cm; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31). Based on the summary statistic calculated for each study, the mean difference (MD) between intervention and control groups ranged from 0.48 cm (95% CI 0.07 to 0.89) to 1.3 cm (95% CI 0.03 to 2.57) after 3 and 12 months of intervention, respectively. Data on potential adverse effects were lacking.Authors' conclusions:&nbsp;The scarcity of available studies and their heterogeneity makes it difficult to reach any firm conclusions. The review findings suggest supplementary feeding has a negligible impact on child growth; however, the pooled results should be interpreted with great caution because the studies included in the review are clinically diverse. Future studies should address issues of research design, including sample size calculation, to detect meaningful clinical effects and adequate intervention allocation concealment. In the meantime, families and children in need should be provided appropriate feeding, health care and sanitation without waiting for new RCTs to establish a research basis for feeding children.",8,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Nutrition,NA,NA,Health,Basic Health,Basic nutrition,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,NA,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not Applicable,NA,4,Multi-continent,Multi-country,NA,No,NA,2,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Authors did specify quality assessment tool.

Several interventions, such as micronutrient and food supplements, deworming, maternal education, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), could potentially be provided to prevent stunting, but their comparative effectiveness is currently unclear. In this study, we evaluated comparative effectiveness of interventions under these domains on child linear growth outcomes of height-for-age z-score (HAZ) and stunting (HAZ &lt;-2SD)Methods:&nbsp;For this study, we searched for low- and middle-income country (LMIC)-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of aforementioned interventions provided to children during CFP. We searched for reports published until September 17, 2019 and hand-searched bibliographies of existing reviews. We performed random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) for HAZ and stunting.Results:&nbsp;The evidence base for our NMA was based on 79 RCTs (96 papers) involving 81,786 children.

As heterogeneity was anticipated, random-effects network meta-analysis models were performed. In all models, an empirically informative heterogeneity prior distribution were used, as suggested by Rhodes et al.42 for continuous outcomes and Turner et al.43for dichotomous outcome, to stabilize the estimation of heterogeneity in the face of low number of trials per comparison in the network.

The majority of the randomized clinical trial evidence base was confined to the micronutrient supplementation domain (n = 50), and the evidence base for intervention domains for food supplements, deworming, maternal education, and WASH being limited. This imbalance in intervention class could partly be explained by the narrow bounds in the population criterion (i.e. the age criteria of 6 to 24 months) of our PICOS criteria. For instance, there were a number of trials that recruited children using a wider age eligibility criterion (e.g. 6 months up to 5 years of age) that encompassed children in the complementary feeding life stage (page 10).",Medium,"In this study, systematic literature review and network metaanalysis were used to determine the comparative effectiveness of interventions for linear growth under the domains of micronutrients, food supplements, deworming, maternal education, and WASH interventions for LMIC-based children in the age group of 6 to 24 months.

Deworming, maternal education, food supplements, and WASH interventions, on the other hand, did not show improvements in HAZ versus standard-of-care. For stunting, food supplements of fortified LNS 220–280 kcal and flour 270–340 kcal showed reduced risks of stunting, with other interventions such as iron, MMN, and MMN combined with maternal education, demonstrating trends towards reduced stunting risks, in comparison to standard-of-care.

There have been many individual studies and several reviews of social accountability approaches but the implications of their findings to inform future accountability efforts are not clear. We addressed this gap by conducting a review of reviews in order to summarise the current evidence on social accountability for RMNCAH, identify factors contributing to intermediary outcomes and health impacts, and identify future research and implementation priorities. The review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42019134340). We searched eight databases and systematic review repositories and sought expert recommendations for published and unpublished reviews, with no date or language restrictions. Six reviews were analysed using narrative synthesis: four on accountability or social accountability approaches for RMNCAH, and two specifically examining perinatal mortality audits, from which we extracted information relating to community involvement in audits. Our findings confirmed that there is extensive and growing evidence for social accountability approaches, particularly community monitoring interventions. Few documented social accountability approaches to RMNCAH achieve transformational change by going beyond information-gathering and awareness-raising, and attention to marginalised and vulnerable groups, including adolescents, has not been well documented. Drawing generalisable conclusions about results was difficult, due to inconsistent nomenclature and gaps in reporting, particularly regarding objectives, contexts, and health impacts. Promising approaches for successful social accountability initiatives include careful tailoring to the social and political context, strategic planning, and multi-sectoral/multi-stakeholder approaches.

We also included socioeconomic outcomes, productivity, or acceptability of fortified products. Design: Randomized controlled trials, RCT.
We excluded studies with children under 5 years and adults over 50 years. (page 2)
Potentially relevant studies were assessed by full text according to the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. A data extraction form was developed using Microsoft Excel, pilot tested on a small selection of studies and adjusted as necessary. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by a second reviewer.
To assess risk of bias of the included studies, quality assessment forms were developed on Microsoft Excel using current guidelines for the conduct of interventional studies [12]. We included the following domains: randomization (generation of random sequence; allocation concealment); blinding of participants; incomplete outcome data; and selective outcome reporting. According to pre-specified criteria for risk-of-bias assessment, data were extracted for each included RCT.

If means andstandard deviations of changes were not reported, we calculated change as the difference betweenbaseline and final values for the intervention and control group and applied the SD of final values [7].For anemia rates, we calculated risk ratios and 95%-CI. We calculated the heterogeneity betweenthe analyzed studies with I2, which is the percentage of the variation in the estimated effects due toheterogeneity rather than by chance [14]. I2 lies between 0% and 100%. A rough guide to interpretationis as follows: Heterogeneity of 0% to 40% might not be important; a range of 30% to 60% mayrepresent moderate, 50% to 90% substantial, and 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity. We testedthe robustness of results by calculating weighted mean differences for hemoglobin concentrations atthe end of follow-up.Furthermore, we divided our studies into reasonable subgroups, as pre-specified in our protocol,and performed subgroup analyses depending on the data available. Domains for subgroups comprisedfortification strategy (single MN strategy vs. dual/multi MN strategy), region (Asia vs. Africa), foodcarrier (condiments vs. noodles), type of iron salt (NaFeEDTA vs. other salts) and risk of bias (low vs.intermediate/high). Studies with low risk of bias were defined as fulfilling at least four out of five quality domains (“YES”). An ex-post subgroup analysis compared targeted populations (children oradolescents vs. other populations (mostly women in childbearing age; sometimes entire communities)).Finally, we performed a meta-regression analysis weighted for the inverse of the variance of theoutcome to assess the influence of single parameters on hemoglobin change [14]. Such parameterswere hemoglobin concentrations before intervention, follow-up completeness, and length of follow-up",Robustness,None,"There are also several limitations to be mentioned. First, the risk of bias in the included studies is unclear, due to poor reporting of the randomization procedure in the primary studies. Second, the statistical heterogeneity between the analyzed trials was high, thus pooled estimates have to be interpreted carefully. Third, we did not screen all references independently by two reviewers and did not perform independent, double data extraction or assessment of risk of bias. This could have led to bias. Fourth, we could have missed some studies because of the broad field of possible search terms for “condiments”. Finally, as only one noodle study was retrieved, there is insufficient aggregated evidence to conclude whether noodles by themselves improve health outcomes. (page 12)",High,"Micronutrient fortification of condiments and noodles increased hemoglobin concentrations by 0.74 g/dL (95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI): 0.56 to 0.93; 12 studies) and 0.3 g/dL (95%-CI: 0.12 to 0.48; 1 study), respectively.

This systematic review aimed to assess the impacts of school feeding on educational and health outcomes ofchildren and adolescents in LMICs. Methods Interventional studies on the effects of school feeding on nutritional and health outcomes of children and adolescents receiving primary or secondary education in LMICs were included. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature were searched (through December 2019) to identify eligible studies. We included randomized controlled trials and controlled before-after studies on school feeding conducted in LMICs among children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 who received primary or secondary education. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analyses were performed for outcomes available in three or more independent studies. Subgroup analyses were conductedby study design and school feeding modality whenever possible. Results Fifty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria for the review, including 44 randomized controlled trials and 13 controlled before-after studies; 19 articles were included in the meta-analysis. School feeding resulted in a significant increase in height (mean difference=0.32 cm; confidence interval (CI)=0.03, 0.61; P=0.032) and weight (mean difference: 0.58 kg; 95% 95% CI=0.22, 0.93; P=0.001) over 12 months, compared to those in the control groups. School feeding also resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of school days attended (2.6%; 95% CI=1.2%, 3.9%; P&lt;0.001).

We used the random-effects method because the effect of school feeding is presumed to be heterogeneous across time and populations, and also because the menus of previous school feeding interventions have been quite heterogeneous. (page 4)",Other,Limitations acknowledged,"This study has a few potential limitations. First, as most of the included studies had relatively short follow-up periods, we could not make strong inferences
regarding the long-term impacts of the school feeding interventions. Second, most of the studies compared school feeding intervention with no intervention at all, which limited our abilities to evaluate whether different contents of school feeding interventions may have different impacts. Third, as a limited number of studies
reported process details of the intervention such as the fidelity of the intervention [90] or provided stratified estimates by age or sex, our abilities to conduct subgroup analyses by those characteristics were constrained. Fourth, combining estimates of anthropometry measures across studies conducted among different age groups of children and adolescents was not ideal. However, we also included more age-standardized metrics whenever possible (eg, HAZ, WAZ, and BAZ), which lessened this issue. (page 23)",High,"Comprehensive at the time of publication, this Cochrane systematic review included five RCTs conducted in LMICs. More recent reviews on the benefits of school feeding interventions are available but were limited in scope. A qualitative review assessed the impacts of school feeding on the education and health of children in primary schools in LMICs [12]. However, studies conducted at the secondary school level or published before 1990 were not included in this review. Another two reviews [86,87] evaluated interventions for improving education outcomes among children and adolescents in LMICs. Nonetheless, they did not specifically focus on school feeding, nor did they include outcomes related to nutrition andhealth. The impacts of school feeding on the anthropometry and nutritional status of primary-school-age children and preschool and adolescent girls in LMICs have been reviewed [13], but this work did not specifically examine the impacts on educational outcomes.

Based on prior evidence and a previous version of this review, the World Health Organization has continued to recommend vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6 to 59 months. There are new data available from recently published randomised trials since the previous publication of this review in 2010, and this update incorporates this information and reviews the evidence.Objectives:&nbsp;To assess the effects of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for preventing morbidity and mortality in children aged six months to five years.Search methods:&nbsp;In March 2016 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted relevant organisations and researchers to identify additional studies.Selection criteria:&nbsp;Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of synthetic VAS in children aged six months to five years living in the community. We excluded studies involving children in hospital and children with disease or infection. We also excluded studies evaluating the effects of food fortification, consumption of vitamin A rich foods, or beta-carotene supplementation.Data collection and analysis:&nbsp;For this update, two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and abstracted data, resolving discrepancies by discussion. We performed meta-analyses for outcomes, including all-cause and cause-specific mortality, disease, vision, and side effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.Main results:&nbsp;We identified 47 studies (4 of which are new to this review), involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies took place in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most of the studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about a year. The included studies were at variable overall risk of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias. A meta-analysis for all-cause mortality included 19 trials (1,202,382 children). At longest follow-up, there was a 12% observed reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for vitamin A compared with control using a fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.93; high-quality evidence). This result was sensitive to choice of model, and a random-effects meta-analysis showed a different summary estimate (24% reduction: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88); however, the confidence intervals overlapped with that of the fixed-effect model. Nine trials reported mortality due to diarrhoea and showed a 12% overall reduction for VAS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 participants; high-quality evidence). There was no significant effect for VAS on mortality due to measles, respiratory disease, and meningitis. VAS reduced incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 15 studies; 77,946 participants; low-quality evidence) and measles (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.67; 6 studies; 19,566 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, there was no significant effect on incidence of respiratory disease or hospitalisations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was an increased risk of vomiting within the first 48 hours of VAS (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 4 studies; 10,541 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Authors' conclusions:&nbsp;Vitamin A supplementation is associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children. Therefore, we suggest maintaining the policy of universal supplementation for children under five years of age in populations at risk of VAD. Further placebo-controlled trials of VAS in children between six months and five years of age would not change the conclusions of this review, although studies that compare different doses and delivery mechanisms are needed.

For studies that randomised individuals, we gave preference to data that required the least manipulation by authors or inference by reviewers. We extracted raw values (for example, means and standard deviations) rather than calculated eGect sizes (for example, Cohen's d). For mortality data, we gave preference to denominators in the following order: number with definite outcome known (or imputed as described below), number randomised, and child-years. For other dichotomous outcomes to which both survivors and non-survivors may have contributed data (for example, incidence of measles), we gave preference to child years, number with definite outcome known, and number randomised.In the case of cluster-RCTs, we used either adjusted estimates reported by the trial authors or raw data, and we inflated the standard error (SE) using the procedures described below in the Unit of analysis issues section.

Pregnancy, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) period (0-6 months), and complementary feeding (CF) period (6-24 months) have different growth requirements, so separate considerations for intervention strategies are needed. No synthesis to date has attempted to quantify the associations of interventions under multiple domains of micronutrient and balanced energy protein and food supplements, deworming, maternal education, water sanitation, and hygiene across these 3 life periods with birth and growth outcomes.ObjectiveTo determine the magnitude of association of interventions with birth and growth outcomes based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) using Bayesian network meta-analyses.Data SourcesMEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from their inception up to August 14, 2018.Study SelectionIncluded were LMIC-based RCTs of interventions provided to pregnant women, infants (0-6 months), and children (6-24 months).Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo independent reviewers used a standardized data extraction and quality assessment form. Random-effects network meta-analyses were performed for each life period. Effect sizes are reported as odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MeanDiffs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). This study calculated probabilities of interventions being superior to standard of care by at least a minimal clinically important difference.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe study compared ORs on preterm birth and MeanDiffs on birth weight for pregnancy, length for age (LAZ) for EBF, and height for age (HAZ) for CF.ResultsAmong 302 061 participants in 169 randomized clinical trials, the network meta-analyses found several nutritional interventions that demonstrated greater association with improved birth and growth outcomes compared with standard of care. For instance, compared with standard of care, maternal supplements of multiple micronutrients showed reduced odds for preterm birth (OR, 0.54; 95% CrI, 0.27-0.97) and improved mean birth weight (MeanDiff, 0.08 kg; 95% CrI, 0.00-0.17 kg) but not LAZ during EBF (MeanDiff, −0.02; 95% CrI, −0.18 to 0.14). Supplementing infants and children with multiple micronutrients showed improved LAZ (MeanDiff, 0.20; 95% CrI, 0.03-0.35) and HAZ (MeanDiff, 0.14; 95% CrI, 0.02-0.25). The study found that pregnancy interventions generally had higher probabilities of a minimal clinically importance difference than the interventions for the EBF or CF in the first 1000 days of life.Conclusions and RelevanceThese analyses highlight the importance of intervening early for child development, during pregnancy if possible.

Few interventions are focused on urban slums. The literature needs a systematic assessment, as infants and children living in slums are at high risk of stunting. Urban slums are complex environments in terms of biological, social, and political variables and the outcomes of nutritional interventions need to be assessed in relation to these variables. For the purposes of this review, we followed the UN-Habitat 2004 definitions for low-income informal settlements or slums as lacking one or more indicators of basic services or infrastructure.Objectives:&nbsp;To assess the impact of nutritional interventions to reduce stunting in infants and children under five years old in urban slums from LMIC and the effect of nutritional interventions on other nutritional (wasting and underweight) and non-nutritional outcomes (socioeconomic, health and developmental) in addition to stunting.Search methods:&nbsp;The review used a sensitive search strategy of electronic databases, bibliographies of articles, conference proceedings, websites, grey literature, and contact with experts and authors published from 1990. We searched 32 databases, in English and non-English languages (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, etc). We performed the initial literature search from November 2015 to January 2016, and conducted top up searches in March 2017 and in August 2018.Selection criteria:&nbsp;Research designs included randomised (including cluster-randomised) trials, quasi-randomised trials, non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, pre- and postintervention, interrupted time series (ITS), and historically controlled studies among infants and children from LMIC, from birth to 59 months, living in urban slums. The interventions included were nutrition-specific or maternal education. The primary outcomes were length or height expressed in cm or length-for-age (LFA)/height-for-age (HFA) z-scores, and birth weight in grams or presence/absence of low birth weight (LBW).Data collection and analysis:&nbsp;We screened and then retrieved titles and abstracts as full text if potentially eligible for inclusion. Working independently, one review author screened all titles and abstracts and extracted data on the selected population, intervention, comparison, and outcome parameters and two other authors assessed half each. We calculated mean selection difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We performed intervention-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, or narrative synthesis when meta-analyses were not possible. We used P less than 0.05 to assess statistical significance and intervention outcomes were also considered for their biological/health importance. Where effect sizes were small and statistically insignificant, we concluded there was 'unclear effect'.Main results:&nbsp;The systematic review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The interventions took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas. The study locations were mainly Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The participants included 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. There were no dietary intervention studies. All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three studies), micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (eight studies), nutrition education for pregnant women (two studies), and nutrition systems strengthening targeting children (two studies) intervention. Six interventions were adapted to the urban context and seven targeted household, community, or 'service delivery' via systems strengthening. The primary review outcomes were available from seven studies for LFA/HFA, four for LBW, and nine for length.The studies had overall high risk of bias for 11 studies and only four RCTs had moderate risk of bias. Overall, the evidence was complex to report, with a wide range of outcome measures reported. Consequently, only eight study findings were reported in meta-analyses and seven in a narrative form. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate overall. None of the studies reported differential impacts of interventions relevant to equity issues.Zinc supplementation of pregnant women on LBW or length (versus supplementation without zinc or placebo) (three RCTs)There was no evidence of an effect on LBW (MD -36.13 g, 95% CI -83.61 to 11.35), with moderate-certainty evidence, or no evidence of an effect or unclear effect on length with low- to moderate-certainty evidence.Micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (versus no intervention or placebo) (eight RCTs)There was no evidence of an effect or unclear effect of nutrient supplementation of children on HFA for studies in the meta-analysis with low-certainty evidence (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02), and inconclusive effect on length for studies reported in a narrative form with very low- to moderate-certainty evidence.Nutrition education for pregnant women (versus standard care or no intervention) (two RCTs)There was a positive impact on LBW of education interventions in pregnant women, with low-certainty evidence (MD 478.44g, 95% CI 423.55 to 533.32).Nutrition systems strengthening interventions targeting children (compared with no intervention, standard care) (one RCT and one controlled before-and-after study)There were inconclusive results on HFA, with very low- to low-certainty evidence, and a positive influence on length at 18 months, with low-certainty evidence.Authors' conclusions:&nbsp;All the nutritional interventions reviewed had the potential to decrease stunting, based on evidence from outside of slum contexts; however, there was no evidence of an effect of the interventions included in this review (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Challenges linked to urban slum programming (high mobility, lack of social services, and high loss of follow-up) should be taken into account when nutrition-specific interventions are proposed to address LBW and stunting in such environments. More evidence is needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions, combining nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes, as well as the effects of 'up-stream' practices and policies of governmental, non-governmental organisations, and the business sector on nutrition-related outcomes such as stunting.",8,Health,Health,Human development and gender,Nutrition,NA,NA,Health,Basic Health,Basic nutrition,NA,NA,NA,Good Health and Well-being,NA,NA,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not Applicable,NA,6,Multi-continent,Multi-country,NA,No,NA,2,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Narrative synthesis,NA,Cochrane - Risk of Bias tool,NA,NA,3,Academic institution,AXA Research Fund postdoctoral grant,3,NA,NA,NA,Nutrient supplementation | Nutrient fortification in foods | Food transfers,"All of the interventions were nutrition-specific or nutrition-sensitive with nutritional intervention being the

search terms in French, Spanish, and any other languages for slumspecific terms. The search included all publications from January
1990 up to March 2017. An updated search in August 2018 was
limited to optimised search strategies of PubMed and CENTRAL

other databases did not contribute to the retrieval of relevant
published studies. Findings from publications before 1990 may be

These summaries report the number of statistically significant effects against non-statisticallysignificant ones, thus providing a very general indication of the direction of effect based on the available evidence. Whenever possible, we report effect sizes and P values, but these were often not available or not comparable across studies. In the case of effect on serum retinol concentration, we were able to do a meta-analysis, albeit on a small number of studies. We used a fixed effect model, because when the number of observations is small the estimates of a random effect model tend to be imprecise.

The literature has not reached a firm conclusion on the impact of the adoption of improved seeds on poverty and welfare, primarily because, as is well acknowledged, this empirical literature is subject to multiple potential biases that tend to inflate the contribution of agricultural technologies to reducing poverty. The International Fund for Agricultural Development has funded many improved seeds interventions, led by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research centres, between 2007 and 2015. In this paper, we assess the overall impact of these CGIAR interventions over this period. After a systematic review of experimental and quasi-experimental impact evaluations was conducted, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed on seven papers on poverty, 12 papers on income, and eight papers on expenditure in relation to various food crops and included unpublished studies. Our major contribution is thus the systematic treatment of this imperfect literature, coding and classifying each study according to its risk of bias, and examining the correlation between bias scores and the outcomes of each study. Nevertheless, we found that improved varieties reduced poverty by 4 per cent (although this finding is not statistically significant), increased income by 35 per cent and increased expenditure by 14 per cent in adopting households in rural areas. In the meta-regression, welfare improvements associated with improved varieties uptake was found to be positively correlated with the studies’ risk of bias. These results point to the fact that, although agricultural research and improved varieties have been effectively contributing to welfare improvements through direct channels – that is, productivity gains – the quality of the counterfactual-based evaluative evidence remains remarkably low. Further efforts need to be made to improve the evidence base to validate the positive impacts and further encourage donors to invest in this area of agricultural research.",6,"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry",Crops,Urban and rural development,Rural infrastructure and service delivery,NA,NA,"Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing",Agriculture,Agricultural inputs,NA,NA,NA,Life on Land,NA,NA,Does not address gender or equity,Not applicable,Not Applicable,NA,5,Multi-continent,Multi-country,NA,No,NA,3,Effectiveness,NA,Meta-analysis,NA,Not applicable,NA,Other,NA,NA,5,Not specified,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,Improved inputs for agriculture,"the studies included examined the impact of the adoption of

The systematic review protocol as described in Waddingtonet al. (2014) was then followed to appraise and quantify the direct aggregate impact of improvedvarieties. This methodology was divided into four steps: (1) the search for relevant studies, (2)the critical appraisal of the selected studies, (3) the meta-analysis and (4) the meta-regression. Acomprehensive search was therefore conducted across several databases covering the period from2007 to 2015, using a strict search strategy; the ultimate sample analysed included seven paperson poverty, 12 papers on income and eight papers on expenditure in relation to various crops(rice, wheat, maize, bananas, chickpea, pigeon pea and groundnut), and it included unpublishedpapers. In the critical appraisal, in which criteria related to both internal and external validitywere assessed, we found that the reviewed studies suffered from biases relating to programmeplacement (i.e. selection bias) and other confounding factors, which might indicate that theresults were not precisely representative of actual impacts. The findings show that CGIAR-ledimproved varieties interventions reduced poverty by 4 per cent, increased income by 35 percent and increased expenditure by 14 per cent in adopting households compared with a validcomparison group. Results for the poverty outcome are, however, not significant, possibly owingto the small number of rigorous studies included in the sample, along with the lack of precisionin the studies’ estimates. Results were also stratified by region, crop type and study quality togain a better understanding of the relationship between the magnitude of the effect size andthese moderator variables.
